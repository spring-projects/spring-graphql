[[overview]]
== Overview

Spring GraphQL provides support for Spring applications built on
https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java]. It is a joint collaboration between both
teams. Our shared philosophy is to be less opinionated and more focused on
comprehensive and wide-ranging support.

Spring GraphQL is the successor of the
https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-spring[GraphQL Java Spring] project from
the GraphQL Java team. It aims to be the foundation for all Spring, GraphQL applications.

The project is in a milestone phase towards a 1.0 release, currently, and looking for
feedback. Please, use our
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql/issues[issue tracker] to report a
problem, discuss a design issue, or request a feature.

To get started, please see the <<boot-graphql>> and the <<samples>> sections.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

Spring GraphQL requires the following as a baseline:

* JDK8
* Spring Framework 5.3
* GraphQL Java 17
* Spring Data 2021.1.0 or later for QueryDSL or Query by Example



[[web-transports]]
== Web Transports

Spring GraphQL supports GraphQL requests over HTTP and over WebSocket.



[[web-http]]
=== HTTP

`GraphQlHttpHandler` handles GraphQL over HTTP requests and delegates to the
<<web-interception>> chain for request execution. There are two variants, one for
Spring MVC and one for Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have
equivalent functionality, but rely on blocking vs non-blocking I/O respectively for
writing the HTTP response.

Requests must use HTTP POST with GraphQL request details included as JSON in the
request body, as defined in the proposed
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md[GraphQL over HTTP]
specification. Once the JSON body has been successfully decoded, the HTTP response
status is always 200 (OK), and any errors from GraphQL request execution appear in the
"errors" section of the GraphQL response.

`GraphQlHttpHandler` can be exposed as an HTTP endpoint by declaring a `RouterFunction`
bean and using the `RouterFunctions` from Spring MVC or WebFlux to create the route. The
Boot starter does this, see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details or check
`GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains a Spring MVC
{github-main-branch}/samples/webmvc-http[HTTP sample] application.



[[web-websocket]]
=== WebSocket

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` handles GraphQL over WebSocket requests based on the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md[protocol] defined in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The main reason to use
GraphQL over WebSocket is subscriptions which allow sending a stream of GraphQL
responses, but it can also be used for regular queries with a single response.
The handler delegates every request to the <<web-interception>> chain for further
request execution.

[TIP]
.GraphQL Over WebSocket Protocols
====
There are two such protocols, one in the
https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws[subscriptions-transport-ws]
library and another in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The former is not active and
succeeded by the latter. Read this
https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-over-websockets[blog post] for the history.
====

There are two variants of `GraphQlWebSocketHandler`, one for Spring MVC and one for
Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have equivalent functionality.
The WebFlux handler also uses non-blocking I/O and back pressure to stream messages,
which works well since in GraphQL Java a subscription response is a Reactive Streams
`Publisher`.

The `graphql-ws` project lists a number of
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws#recipes[recipes] for client use.

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` can be exposed as a WebSocket endpoint by declaring a
`SimpleUrlHandlerMapping` bean and using it to map the handler to a URL path. The Boot
starter has options to enable this, see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details or check
`GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains a WebFlux
{github-main-branch}/samples/webflux-websocket[WebSocket sample] application.



[[web-interception]]
=== Web Interception

<<web-http>> and <<web-websocket>> transport handlers delegate to a common Web
interception chain for request execution. The chain consists of a sequence of
`WebInterceptor` components, followed by a `GraphQlService` that invokes the GraphQL
Java engine.

`WebInterceptor` is as a common contract to use in both Spring MVC and WebFlux
applications. Use it to intercept requests, inspect HTTP request headers, or to register a
transformation of the `graphql.ExecutionInput`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebOutput> intercept(WebInput webInput, WebInterceptorChain chain) {
		webInput.configureExecutionInput((executionInput, builder) -> {
			Map<String, Object> map = ... ;
			return builder.extensions(map).build();
		});
		return chain.next(webInput);
	}
}
----

Use `WebInterceptor` also to intercept responses, add HTTP response headers, or transform
the `graphql.ExecutionResult`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebOutput> intercept(WebInput webInput, WebInterceptorChain chain) {
		return chain.next(webInput)
				.map(webOutput -> {
					Object data = webOutput.getData();
					Object updatedData = ... ;
					return webOutput.transform(builder -> builder.data(updatedData));
				});
	}
}
----

`WebGraphQlHandler` provides a builder to initialize the Web interception chain. After
you build the chain, you can use the resulting `WebGraphQlHandler` to initialize the HTTP
or WebSocket transport handlers. The Boot starter configures all this,
see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details, or check `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or
`GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.




[[execution]]
== Request Execution

`GraphQlService` is the main Spring GraphQL abstraction to call GraphQL Java to execute
requests. Underlying transports, such as the <<web-transports>>, delegate to `GraphQlService` to
handle requests.

The main implementation, `ExecutionGraphQlService`, is a thin facade around the
invocation of `graphql.GraphQL`. It is configured with a `GraphQlSource` for access to
the `graphql.GraphQL` instance.



[[execution-graphqlsource]]
=== `GraphQLSource`

`GraphQlSource` is a core Spring GraphQL abstraction for access to the
`graphql.GraphQL` instance to use for request execution. It provides a builder API to
initialize GraphQL Java and build a `GraphQlSource`.

The default `GraphQlSource` builder, accessible via `GraphQlSource.builder()`, enables
support for <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>>, <<execution-context>>, and
<<execution-exceptions>>.



[[execution-graphqlsource-schema-resources]]
==== Schema Resources

`GraphQlSource.Builder` can be configured with one or more `Resource` instances to be
parsed and merged together. That means schema files can be loaded from just about any
location. By default, the Spring Boot starter <<boot-graphql-schema,loads schema files>>
from a well-known classpath location, but you can change that to a location on the file system
via `FileSystemResource`, to byte content via `ByteArrayResource`, or implement a custom
`Resource` that loads schema files from a remote location or storage.


[[execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer]]
==== `RuntimeWiringConfigurer`

You can add a `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` to `GraphQlSource.Builder` to register:

 - Custom scalar types.
 - Directives handling code.
 - `TypeResolver`, if you need to override the
   <<execution-graphqlsource-default-type-resolver>> for a type.
 - `DataFetcher` for a field, although most applications will simply configure
   `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer`, which detects annotated, `DataFetcher` handler methods.
   The Spring Boot starter adds the `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` by default.


[[execution-graphqlsource-default-type-resolver]]
==== Default `TypeResolver`

`GraphQlSource.Builder` registers `ClassNameTypeResolver` as the default `TypeResolver`
to use for GraphQL Interfaces and Unions that don't already have such a registration
through a <<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>>. The purpose of
a `TypeResolver` in GraphQL Java is to determine the GraphQL Object type for values
returned from the `DataFetcher` for a GraphQL Interface or Union field.

`ClassNameTypeResolver` tries to match the simple class name of the value to a GraphQL
Object Type and if it is not successful, it also navigates its super types including
base classes and interfaces, looking for a match. `ClassNameTypeResolver` provides an
option to configure a name extracting function along with `Class` to GraphQL Object type
name mappings that should help to cover more corner cases.




[[execution-reactive-datafetcher]]
=== Reactive `DataFetcher`

The default `GraphQlSource` builder enables support for a `DataFetcher` to return `Mono`
or `Flux` which adapts those to a `CompletableFuture` where `Flux` values are aggregated
and turned into a List, unless the request is a GraphQL subscription request,
in which case the return value remains a Reactive Streams `Publisher` for streaming
GraphQL responses.

A reactive `DataFetcher` can rely on access to Reactor context propagated from the
transport layer, such as from a WebFlux request handling, see
<<execution-context-webflux, WebFlux Context>>.



[[execution-context]]
=== Context Propagation

Spring GraphQL provides support to transparently propagate context from the <<web-transports>>,
through the GraphQL engine, and to `DataFetcher` and other components it invokes.
This includes both `ThreadLocal` context from the Spring MVC request handling thread and
Reactor `Context` from the WebFlux processing pipeline.


[[execution-context-webmvc]]
==== WebMvc

A `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by GraphQL Java may not always execute on
the same thread as the Spring MVC handler, for example if an asynchronous
<<web-interception, `WebInterceptor`>> or `DataFetcher` switches to a different thread.

Spring GraphQL supports propagating `ThreadLocal` values from the Servlet container
thread to the thread a `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by the GraphQL engine
execute on. To do this, an application needs to create a `ThreadLocalAccessor` to extract
`ThreadLocal` values of interest:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class RequestAttributesAccessor implements ThreadLocalAccessor {

	private static final String KEY = RequestAttributesAccessor.class.getName();

	@Override
	public void extractValues(Map<String, Object> container) {
		container.put(KEY, RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes());
	}

	@Override
	public void restoreValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		if (values.containsKey(KEY)) {
			RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes((RequestAttributes) values.get(KEY));
		}
	}

	@Override
	public void resetValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		RequestContextHolder.resetRequestAttributes();
	}

}
----

A `ThreadLocalAccessor` can be registered in the <<web-interception,WebGraphHandler>>
builder. The Boot starter detects beans of this type and automatically registers them for
Spring MVC application, see <<boot-graphql-web>>.


[[execution-context-webflux]]
==== WebFlux

A <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>> can rely on access to Reactor context that
originates from the WebFlux request handling chain. This includes Reactor context
added by <<web-interception, WebInterceptor>> components.



[[execution-exceptions]]
=== Exception Resolution

GraphQL Java applications can register a `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` to decide how to
represent exceptions from the data layer in the "errors" section of the GraphQL response.

Spring GraphQL has a built-in `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` that is configured for use
by the <<execution-graphqlsource>> builder. It enables applications to register one or
more Spring `DataFetcherExceptionResolver` components that are invoked sequentially
until one resolves the `Exception` to a list of `graphql.GraphQLError` objects.

`DataFetcherExceptionResolver` is an asynchronous contract. For most implementations, it
would be sufficient to extend `DataFetcherExceptionResolverAdapter` and override
one of its `resolveToSingleError` or `resolveToMultipleErrors` methods that
resolve exceptions synchronously.

A `GraphQLError` can be assigned an `graphql.ErrorClassification`. Spring GraphQL
defines an `ErrorType` enum with common, error classification categories:

- `BAD_REQUEST`
- `UNAUTHORIZED`
- `FORBIDDEN`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

Applications can use this to classify errors. If an error remains unresolved, by
default it is marked as `INTERNAL_ERROR`.



[[execution-batching]]
=== Batching

Given a `Book` and its `Author`, we can create one `DataFetcher` for books and another
for the author of a book. This means books and authors aren't automatically loaded
together, which enables queries to select the subset of data they need. However, loading
multiple books, results in loading each author individually, and this is a performance
issue known as the N+1 select problem.

GraphQL Java provides a
https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/v16/batching/[batching feature] that allows
related entities, such as the authors for all books, to be loaded together. This is how
the underlying mechanism works in GraphQL Java:

 - For each request, an application can register a batch loading function as a
`DataLoader` in the `DataLoaderRegistry` to assist with loading instances of a given
entity, such as `Author` from a set of unique keys.
 - A `DataFetcher` can access the `DataLoader` for the entity and use it to load entity
instances; for example the author `DataFetcher` obtains the authorId from the `Book`
parent object, and uses it to load the `Author`.
 - `DataLoader` does not load the entity immediately but rather returns a future, and
defers until it is ready to batch load all related entities as one.
 - `DataLoader` additionally maintains a cache of previously loaded entities that can
further improve efficiency when the same entity is in multiple places of the response.

Spring GraphQL provides:

 - `BatchLoaderRegistry` that accepts and stores registrations of batch loading functions;
This is used in `ExecutionGraphQlService` to make `DataLoader` registrations per request.
 - <<controllers-schema-mapping-data-loader,DataLoader argument>> for `@SchemaMapping`
methods to access the `DataLoader` for the field type.
 - <<controllers-batch-mapping,@BatchMapping>> data controller methods that provide a
shortcut and avoid the need to use `DataLoader` directly.

The Spring Boot starter declares a
<<boot-graphql-batch-loader-registry,BatchLoaderRegistry bean>>, so that applications can
simply autowire the registry into their controllers in order to register batch loading
functions for entities.





[[data]]
== Data Integration

[[data-querydsl]]
=== Querydsl

Spring GraphQL supports use of http://www.querydsl.com/[Querydsl] to fetch data through
the Spring Data
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#core.extensions[Querydsl extension].
Querydsl provides a flexible yet typesafe approach to express query predicates by
generating a meta-model using annotation processors.

For example, declare a repository as `QuerydslPredicateExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QuerydslPredicateExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Then use it to create a `DataFetcher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();
----

The `DataFetcher` builds a Querydsl `Predicate` from GraphQL request parameters, and
uses it to fetch data. Spring Data supports `QuerydslPredicateExecutor` for JPA,
MongoDB, and LDAP.

If the repository is `ReactiveQuerydslPredicateExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB.


[[data-querydsl-build]]
==== Build Setup

To configure Querydsl in your build, follow the
https://querydsl.com/static/querydsl/latest/reference/html/ch02.html[official reference documentation]:

For example:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="primary"]
.Gradle
----
dependencies {
	//...

	annotationProcessor "com.querydsl:querydsl-apt:$querydslVersion:jpa",
            'org.hibernate.javax.persistence:hibernate-jpa-2.1-api:1.0.2.Final',
            'javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2'
}

compileJava {
    options.annotationProcessorPath = configurations.annotationProcessor
}
----
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Maven
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.querydsl</groupId>
		<artifactId>querydsl-apt</artifactId>
		<version>${querydsl.version}</version>
		<classifier>jpa</classifier>
		<scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.hibernate.javax.persistence</groupId>
		<artifactId>hibernate-jpa-2.1-api</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.2.Final</version>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>javax.annotation</groupId>
		<artifactId>javax.annotation-api</artifactId>
		<version>1.3.2</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
<plugins>
	<!-- Annotation processor configuration -->
	<plugin>
		<groupId>com.mysema.maven</groupId>
		<artifactId>apt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>${apt-maven-plugin.version}</version>
		<executions>
			<execution>
				<goals>
					<goal>process</goal>
				</goals>
				<configuration>
					<outputDirectory>target/generated-sources/java</outputDirectory>
					<processor>com.querydsl.apt.jpa.JPAAnnotationProcessor</processor>
				</configuration>
			</execution>
		</executions>
	</plugin>
</plugins>
----

The {github-main-branch}/samples/webmvc-http[webmvc-http] sample uses Querydsl for
`artifactRepositories`.


[[data-querydsl-customizations]]
==== Customizations

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports customizing how GraphQL arguments are bound onto properties
to create a Querydsl `Predicate`. By default, arguments are bound as "is equal to" for
each available property. To customize that, you can use `QuerydslDataFetcher` builder
methods to provide a `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`.

A repository may itself be an instance of `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`. This is auto-detected
and transparently applied during <<data-querydsl-registration>>. However, when manually
building a `QuerydslDataFetcher` you will need to use builder methods to apply it.

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[interface and DTO projections]
to transform query results before returning these for further GraphQL processing.


[[data-querydsl-registration]]
==== Auto Registration

If a repository is annotated with `@GraphQlRepository`, it is automatically registered
for queries that do not already have a registered `DataFetcher` and whose return type
matches that of the repository domain type. This includes both single value and multi-value
queries.

By default, the name of the GraphQL type returned by the query must match the simple name
of the repository domain type. If needed, you can use the `typeName` attribute of
`@GraphQlRepository` to specify the target GraphQL type name.

Auto-registration detects if a given repository implements `QuerydslBinderCustomizer` and
transparently applies that through `QuerydslDataFetcher` builder methods.

Auto-registration is performed through a `GraphQLTypeVisitor` which can be obtained from
`QuerydslDataFetcher`. The <<boot-repositories-querydsl,Boot starter>> automatically
detects `@GraphQlRepository` beans and applies the `GraphQLTypeVisitor`.




[[data-querybyexample]]
=== Query by Example

Spring Data supports the use of
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#query-by-example[Query by Example]
to fetch data. Query by Example (QBE) is a simple querying technique that does not require
you to write queries through store-specific query languages.

Start by declaring a repository that is `QueryByExampleExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QueryByExampleExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Use `QueryByExampleDataFetcher` to turn the repository into a `DataFecher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();
----

The `DataFetcher` uses the GraphQL arguments map to create the domain type of the
repository and use that as the example object to fetch data with. Spring Data supports
`QueryByExampleDataFetcher` for JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis.

If the repository is `ReactiveQueryByExampleExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis, and R2dbc.


[[data-querybyexample-build]]
==== Build Setup

Query by Example is already included in the Spring Data modules for the data stores where
it is supported, so no extra setup is required to enable it.


[[data-querybyexample-customizations]]
==== Customizations

`QueryByExampleDataFetcher` supports
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[interface and DTO projections]
to transform query results before returning these for further GraphQL processing.


[[data-querybyexample-registration]]
==== Auto Registration

If a repository is annotated with `@GraphQlRepository`, it is automatically registered
for queries that do not already have a registered `DataFetcher` and whose return type
matches that of the repository domain type. This includes both single value and multi-value
queries.

By default, the name of the GraphQL type returned by the query must match the simple name
of the repository domain type. If needed, you can use the `typeName` attribute of
`@GraphQlRepository` to specify the target GraphQL type name.

Auto-registration is performed through a `GraphQLTypeVisitor` which can be obtained from
`QueryByExampleDataFetcher`. The <<boot-repositories-querybyexample,Boot starter>> automatically
detects `@GraphQlRepository` beans and applies the `GraphQLTypeVisitor`.




[[controllers]]
== Annotated Controllers

Spring GraphQL provides an annotation-based programming model where `@Controller`
components use annotations to declare handler methods with flexible method signatures to
fetch the data for specific GraphQL fields. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class GreetingController {

			@QueryMapping // <1>
			public String hello() { // <2>
				return "Hello, world!";
			}

	}
----
<1> Bind this method to a query, i.e. a field under the Query type.
<2> Determine the query from the method name if not declared on the annotation.

Spring GraphQL uses `RuntimeWiring.Builder` to register the above handler method as a
`graphql.schema.DataFetcher` for the query named "hello".


[[controllers-declaration]]
=== Declaration

You can define `@Controller` beans as standard Spring bean definitions. The
`@Controller` stereotype allows for auto-detection, aligned with Spring general
support for detecting `@Controller` and `@Component` classes on the classpath and
auto-registering bean definitions for them. It also acts as a stereotype for the annotated
class, indicating its role as a data fetching component in a GraphQL application.

`AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` detects `@Controller` beans and registers their
annotated handler methods as ``DataFetcher``s via `RuntimeWiring.Builder`. It is an
implementation of `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` which can be added to `GraphQlSource.Builder`.
The Spring Boot starter automatically declares `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` as a bean
and adds all `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` beans to `GraphQlSource.Builder` and that enables
support for annotated ``DataFetcher``s, see <<boot-graphql-runtimewiring>>.


[[controllers-schema-mapping]]
=== `@SchemaMapping`

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation maps a handler method to a field in the GraphQL schema
and declares it to be the `DataFetcher` for that field. The annotation can specify the
parent type name, and the field name:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book", field="author")
		public Author getAuthor(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can also leave out those attributes, in which case the
field name defaults to the method name, while the type name defaults to the simple class
name of the source/parent object injected into the method. For example, the below
defaults to type "Book" and field "author":

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can be declared at the class level to specify a default
type name for all handler methods in the class.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book")
	public class BookController {

		// @SchemaMapping methods for fields of the "Book" type

	}
----

`@QueryMapping`, `@MutationMapping`, and `@SubscriptionMapping` are meta annotations that
are themselves annotated with `@SchemaMapping` and have the typeName preset to `Query`,
`Mutation`, or `Subscription` respectively. Effectively, these are shortcut annotations
for fields under the Query, Mutation, and Subscription types respectively. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}

		@SubscriptionMapping
		public Flux<Book> newPublications() {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

`@SchemaMapping` handler methods have flexible signatures and can choose from a range of
method arguments and return values..


[[controllers-schema-mapping-signature]]
==== Method Signature

Schema mapping handler methods can have any of the following method arguments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Method Argument | Description

| `@Argument`
| For access to field arguments with conversion.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-argument>>.

| `@ProjectedPayload` Interface
| For access to field arguments through a project interface.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-projectedpayload-argument>>.

| Source
| For access to the source (i.e. parent/container) instance of the field.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-source>>.

| `DataLoader`
| For access to a `DataLoader` in the `DataLoaderRegistry`.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-data-loader>>.

| `@ContextValue`
| For access to a value from the localContext, if it is an instance of `GraphQLContext`,
  or from the `GraphQLContext` of `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `GraphQLContext`
| For access to the context from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Obtained from Spring Security context, if available.

| `DataFetchingFieldSelectionSet`
| For access to the selection set for the query through the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `Locale`, `Optional<Locale>`
| For access to the `Locale` from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `DataFetchingEnvironment`
| For direct access to the underlying `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

|===

Schema mapping handler methods can return any value, including Reactor `Mono` and
`Flux` as described in <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>>.



[[controllers-schema-mapping-argument]]
==== `@Argument`

In GraphQL Java, the `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to field-specific argument
values. The arguments are available as simple scalar values such as String, or as a `Map`
of values  for more complex input, or a `List` of values.

Use `@Argument` to access an argument for the field that maps to the handler method. You
can declare such a method parameter to be of any type.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

You can explicitly specify the argument name, for example `@Argument("bookInput")`, or if
it not specified, it defaults to the method parameter name, but this requires the
`-parameters` compiler flag with Java 8+ or debugging information from the compiler.

The `@Argument` annotation does not have a "required" flag, nor the option to specify a
default value. Both of these can be specified at the GraphQL schema level and are enforced
by the GraphQL Engine.

You can use `@Argument` on a `Map<String, Object>` argument, to obtain all argument
values. The name attribute on `@Argument` must not be set.


[[controllers-schema-mapping-validation]]
==== `@Argument` validation

If a {spring-framework-ref-docs}/core.html#validation-beanvalidation-overview[Bean Validation]
`Validator` (or typically, a `LocalValidatorFactoryBean`) bean is present in the application context,
the `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` will auto-detect it and configure support for validation.
Controller arguments annotated with `@Valid` and `@Validated` are then validated before method invocation.

Bean Validation lets you declare constraints on types, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class BookInput {

    @NotNull
    private String title;

	@NotNull
    @Size(max=13)
    private String isbn;
}
----

We can then mark our argument for validation with `@Valid`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument @Valid BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

If an error occurs during validation, a `ConstraintViolationException` is thrown and can be
later <<execution-exceptions,resolved with a custom `DataFetcherExceptionResolver`>>.

[TIP]
====
Unlike Spring MVC, handler method signatures do not support the injection of `BindingResult`
for reacting to validation errors: those are globally dealt with as exceptions.

[[controllers-schema-mapping-projectedpayload-argument]]
==== `@ProjectPayload` Interface

As an alternative to using complete Objects with <<controllers-schema-mapping-argument>>,
you can also use a projection interface to access GraphQL request arguments through a
well-defined, minimal interface. Argument projections are provided by
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.interfaces[Spring Data's Interface projections]
when Spring Data is on the class path.

To make use of this, create an interface annotated with `@ProjectedPayload` and declare
it as a controller method parameter. If the parameter is annotated with `@Argument`,
it applies to an individual argument within the `DataFetchingEnvironment.getArguments()`
map. When declared without `@Argument`, the projection works on top-level arguments in
the complete arguments map.

For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(BookIdProjection bookId) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInputProjection bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}

	@ProjectedPayload
	interface BookIdProjection {

		Long getId();
	}

	@ProjectedPayload
	interface BookInputProjection {

		String getName();

		@Value("#{target.author + ' ' + target.name}")
		String getAuthorAndName();
	}
----


[[controllers-schema-mapping-source]]
==== Source

In GraphQL Java, the `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to the source (i.e.
parent/container) instance of the field. To access this, simply declare a method parameter
of the expected target type.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The source method argument also helps to determine the type name for the mapping.
If the simple name of the Java class matches the GraphQL type, then there is no need to
explicitly specify the type name in the `@SchemaMapping` annotation.

[TIP]
====
A <<controllers-batch-mapping>> handler method can batch load all authors for a query,
given a list of source/parent books objects.
====


[[controllers-schema-mapping-data-loader]]
==== `DataLoader`

When you register a batch loading function for an entity, as explained in
<<execution-batching>>, you can access the `DataLoader` for the entity by declaring a
method argument of type `DataLoader` and use it to load the entity:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	public BookController(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {
		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerMappedBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
			// return Map<Long, Author>
		});
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	public CompletableFuture<Author> author(Book book, DataLoader<Long, Author> loader) {
		return loader.load(book.getAuthorId());
	}

}
----

By default, `BatchLoaderRegistry` uses the full class name of the value type (e.g. the
class name for `Author`) for the key of the registration, and therefore simply declaring
the `DataLoader` method argument with generic types provides enough information
to locate it in the `DataLoaderRegistry`. As a fallback, the `DataLoader` method argument
resolver will also try the method argument name as the key but typically that should not
be necessary.

[TIP]
====
For straight-forward cases where the `@SchemaMapping` simply delegates to a `DataLoader`,
you can reduce boilerplate by using a <<controllers-batch-mapping,@BatchMapping>> method
instead.
====



[[controllers-batch-mapping]]
=== `@BatchMapping`

<<execution-batching>> addresses the N+1 select problem through the use of an
`org.dataloader.DataLoader` to defer the loading of individual entity instances, so they
can be loaded together. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	public BookController(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {
		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerMappedBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
			// return Map<Long, Author>
		});
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	public CompletableFuture<Author> author(Book book, DataLoader<Long, Author> loader) {
		return loader.load(book.getAuthorId());
	}

}
----

For the straight-forward case of loading an associated entity, shown above, the
`@SchemaMapping` method does nothing more than delegate to the `DataLoader`. This is
boilerplate that can be avoided with a `@BatchMapping` method. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@BatchMapping
		public Mono<Map<Book, Author>> author(List<Book> books) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The above becomes a batch loading function in the `BatchLoaderRegistry`
where keys are `Book` instances and the loaded values their authors. In addition, a
`DataFetcher` is also transparently bound to the `author` field of the type `Book`, which
simply delegates to the `DataLoader` for authors, given its source/parent `Book` instance.

[TIP]
====
To be used as a unique key, `Book` must implement `hashcode` and `equals`.
====

By default, the field name defaults to the method name, while the type name defaults to
the simple class name of the input `List` element type. Both can be customized through
annotation attributes. The type name can also be inherited from a class level
`@SchemaMapping`.


[[controllers-batch-mapping-signature]]
==== Method Signature

Batch mapping methods support the following arguments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Method Argument | Description

| `List<K>`
| The source/parent objects.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Obtained from Spring Security context, if available.

| `@ContextValue`
| For access to a value from the `GraphQLContext` of `BatchLoaderEnvironment`,
  which is the same context as the one from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `GraphQLContext`
| For access to the context from the `BatchLoaderEnvironment`,
  which is the same context as the one from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `BatchLoaderEnvironment`
| The environment that is available in GraphQL Java to a
`org.dataloader.BatchLoaderWithContext`.


|===

Batch mapping methods can return:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Return Type | Description

| `Mono<Map<K,V>>`
| A map with parent objects as keys, and batch loaded objects as values.

| `Flux<V>`
| A sequence of batch loaded objects that must be in the same order as the source/parent
  objects passed into the method.

| `Map<K,V>`, `List<V>`
| Imperative variants, e.g. without remote calls to make.

|===




[[security]]
== Security

The path to a <<web-transports, Web>> GraphQL endpoint can be secured with HTTP
URL security to ensure that only authenticated users can access it. This does not,
however, differentiate among different GraphQL requests on such a shared endpoint on
a single URL.

To apply more fine-grained security, add Spring Security annotations such as
`@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` to service methods involved in fetching specific parts of
the GraphQL response. This should work due to <<execution-context>> that aims to make
Security, and other context, available at the data fetching level.
