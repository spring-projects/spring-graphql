[[overview]]
== Overview

Spring for GraphQL provides support for Spring applications built on
https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java]. It is a joint collaboration between both
teams. Our shared philosophy is to be less opinionated and more focused on
comprehensive and wide-ranging support.

Spring for GraphQL is the successor of the
https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-spring[GraphQL Java Spring] project from
the GraphQL Java team. It aims to be the foundation for all Spring, GraphQL applications.

The project is in a milestone phase towards a 1.0 release, currently, and looking for
feedback. Please, use our
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql/issues[issue tracker] to report a
problem, discuss a design issue, or request a feature.

To get started, check the Spring GraphQL starter on https://start.spring.io and the
<<samples>> sections.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

Spring for GraphQL requires the following as a baseline:

* JDK8
* Spring Framework 5.3
* GraphQL Java 17
* Spring Data 2021.1.0 or later for QueryDSL or Query by Example



[[web-transports]]
== Web Transports

Spring for GraphQL supports GraphQL requests over HTTP and over WebSocket.



[[web-http]]
=== HTTP

`GraphQlHttpHandler` handles GraphQL over HTTP requests and delegates to the
<<web-interception>> chain for request execution. There are two variants, one for
Spring MVC and one for Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have
equivalent functionality, but rely on blocking vs non-blocking I/O respectively for
writing the HTTP response.

Requests must use HTTP POST with GraphQL request details included as JSON in the
request body, as defined in the proposed
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md[GraphQL over HTTP]
specification. Once the JSON body has been successfully decoded, the HTTP response
status is always 200 (OK), and any errors from GraphQL request execution appear in the
"errors" section of the GraphQL response.

`GraphQlHttpHandler` can be exposed as an HTTP endpoint by declaring a `RouterFunction`
bean and using the `RouterFunctions` from Spring MVC or WebFlux to create the route. The
Boot starter does this, see the
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.web-endpoints[Web Endpoints] section for
details, or check `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration`
it contains, for the actual config.

The Spring for GraphQL repository contains a Spring MVC
{github-main-branch}/samples/webmvc-http[HTTP sample] application.



[[web-websocket]]
=== WebSocket

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` handles GraphQL over WebSocket requests based on the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md[protocol] defined in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The main reason to use
GraphQL over WebSocket is subscriptions which allow sending a stream of GraphQL
responses, but it can also be used for regular queries with a single response.
The handler delegates every request to the <<web-interception>> chain for further
request execution.

[TIP]
.GraphQL Over WebSocket Protocols
====
There are two such protocols, one in the
https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws[subscriptions-transport-ws]
library and another in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The former is not active and
succeeded by the latter. Read this
https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-over-websockets[blog post] for the history.
====

There are two variants of `GraphQlWebSocketHandler`, one for Spring MVC and one for
Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have equivalent functionality.
The WebFlux handler also uses non-blocking I/O and back pressure to stream messages,
which works well since in GraphQL Java a subscription response is a Reactive Streams
`Publisher`.

The `graphql-ws` project lists a number of
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws#recipes[recipes] for client use.

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` can be exposed as a WebSocket endpoint by declaring a
`SimpleUrlHandlerMapping` bean and using it to map the handler to a URL path. The Boot
starter has options to enable this, see the
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.web-endpoints[Web Endpoints] section for
details, or check `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration`
it contains, for the actual config.

The Spring for GraphQL repository contains a WebFlux
{github-main-branch}/samples/webflux-websocket[WebSocket sample] application.



[[web-interception]]
=== Web Interception

<<web-http>> and <<web-websocket>> transport handlers delegate to a common Web
interception chain for request execution. The chain consists of a sequence of
`WebGraphQlHandlerInterceptor` components, followed by a `ExecutionGraphQlService` that
invokes GraphQL Java.

`WebGraphQlHandlerInterceptor` is as a common contract to use in both Spring MVC and
WebFlux applications. Use it to intercept requests, inspect HTTP request headers, or to
register a transformation of the `graphql.ExecutionInput`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebGraphQlHandlerInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebGraphQlResponse> intercept(WebGraphQlRequest request, Chain chain) {
		request.configureExecutionInput((executionInput, builder) -> {
			Map<String, Object> map = ... ;
			return builder.extensions(map).build();
		});
		return chain.next(request);
	}
}
----

Use `WebGraphQlHandlerInterceptor` also to intercept responses, add HTTP response headers,
or transform the `graphql.ExecutionResult`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebGraphQlHandlerInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebGraphQlResponse> intercept(WebGraphQlRequest request, Chain chain) {
		return chain.next(request)
				.map(response -> {
					Object data = response.getData();
					Object updatedData = ... ;
					return response.transform(builder -> builder.data(updatedData));
				});
	}
}
----

`WebGraphQlHandler` provides a builder to initialize the Web interception chain. After
you build the chain, you can use the resulting `WebGraphQlHandler` to initialize the HTTP
or WebSocket transport handlers. The Boot starter configures all this, see the
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.web-endpoints[Web Endpoints] section for
details, or check `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration`
it contains, for the actual config.


[[execution]]
== Request Execution

`ExecutionGraphQlService` is the main Spring abstraction to call GraphQL Java to execute
requests. Underlying transports, such as the <<web-transports>>, delegate to
`ExecutionGraphQlService` to handle requests.

The main implementation, `DefaultExecutionGraphQlService`, is configured with a
`GraphQlSource` for access to the `graphql.GraphQL` instance to invoke.



[[execution-graphqlsource]]
=== `GraphQLSource`

`GraphQlSource` is a core Spring abstraction for access to the
`graphql.GraphQL` instance to use for request execution. It provides a builder API to
initialize GraphQL Java and build a `GraphQlSource`.

The default `GraphQlSource` builder, accessible via `GraphQlSource.builder()`, enables
support for <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>>, <<execution-context>>, and
<<execution-exceptions>>.

The Spring Boot {spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql[starter] initializes a
`GraphQlSource` instance through the default `GraphQlSource.Builder` and also enables
the following:

- Load <<execution-graphqlsource-schema-resources, schema files>> from a configurable location.
- Expose {spring-boot-ref-docs}/application-properties.html#appendix.application-properties.web[properties]
  that apply to `GraphQlSource.Builder`.
- Detect <<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>> beans.
- Detect https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/instrumentation[Instrumentation] beans for
  {spring-boot-ref-docs}/actuator.html#actuator.metrics.supported.spring-graphql[GraphQL metrics].
- Detect `DataFetcherExceptionResolver` beans for <<execution-exceptions, exception resolution>>.

For further customizations, you can declare your own `GraphQlSourceBuilderCustomizer` beans;
for example, for configuring your own `ExecutionIdProvider`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
class GraphQlConfig {

	@Bean
	public GraphQlSourceBuilderCustomizer sourceBuilderCustomizer() {
		return (builder) -> {
			builder.configureGraphQl(graphQlBuilder ->
				graphQlBuilder.executionIdProvider(new CustomExecutionIdProvider()));
		};
	}
}
----



[[execution-graphqlsource-schema-resources]]
==== Schema Resources

`GraphQlSource.Builder` can be configured with one or more `Resource` instances to be
parsed and merged together. That means schema files can be loaded from just about any
location.

By default, the Spring Boot starter
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.schema[finds schema files] from a
well-known classpath location, but you can change that to a location on the file system
via `FileSystemResource`, to byte content via `ByteArrayResource`, or implement a custom
`Resource` that loads schema files from a remote location or storage.


[[execution-graphqlsource-schema-creation]]
==== Schema Creation

By default, `GraphQlSource.Builder` uses the GraphQL Java `GraphQLSchemaGenerator` to
create the `graphql.schema.GraphQLSchema`. This works for most applications, but if
necessary, you can hook into the schema creation through the builder:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
GraphQlSource.Builder builder = ...

builder.schemaResources(..)
		.configureRuntimeWiring(..)
		.schemaFactory((typeDefinitionRegistry, runtimeWiring) -> {
			// create GraphQLSchema
		})
----

The primary reason for this is to create the schema through a federation library.

The <<execution-graphqlsource, GraphQlSource section>> explains how to configure that with Spring Boot.

[[execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer]]
==== `RuntimeWiringConfigurer`

You can use `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` to register:

 - Custom scalar types.
 - Directives handling code.
 - `TypeResolver`, if you need to override the
   <<execution-graphqlsource-default-type-resolver>> for a type.
 - `DataFetcher` for a field, although most applications will simply configure
   `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer`, which detects annotated, `DataFetcher` handler methods.
   The Spring Boot starter adds the `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` by default.

NOTE: Unlike web frameworks, GraphQL does not use Jackson annotations to drive JSON serialization/deserialization.
Custom data types and their serialization https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/scalars/[must be described as Scalars].

The Spring Boot starter detects beans of type `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` and
registers them in the `GraphQlSource.Builder`. That means in most cases, you'll' have
something like the following in your configuration:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Configuration
public class GraphQlConfig {

	@Bean
	public RuntimeWiringConfigurer runtimeWiringConfigurer(BookRepository repository) {

		GraphQLScalarType scalarType = ... ;
		SchemaDirectiveWiring directiveWiring = ... ;
		DataFetcher dataFetcher = QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

		return wiringBuilder -> wiringBuilder
				.scalar(scalarType)
				.directiveWiring(directiveWiring)
				.type("Query", builder -> builder.dataFetcher("book", dataFetcher));
	}
}
----

If you need to add a `WiringFactory`, e.g. to make registrations that take into account
schema definitions, implement the alternative `configure` method that accepts both the
`RuntimeWiring.Builder` and an output `List<WiringFactory>`. This allows you to add any
number of factories that are then invoked in sequence.


[[execution-graphqlsource-default-type-resolver]]
==== Default `TypeResolver`

`GraphQlSource.Builder` registers `ClassNameTypeResolver` as the default `TypeResolver`
to use for GraphQL Interfaces and Unions that don't already have such a registration
through a <<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>>. The purpose of
a `TypeResolver` in GraphQL Java is to determine the GraphQL Object type for values
returned from the `DataFetcher` for a GraphQL Interface or Union field.

`ClassNameTypeResolver` tries to match the simple class name of the value to a GraphQL
Object Type and if it is not successful, it also navigates its super types including
base classes and interfaces, looking for a match. `ClassNameTypeResolver` provides an
option to configure a name extracting function along with `Class` to GraphQL Object type
name mappings that should help to cover more corner cases:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
GraphQlSource.Builder builder = ...
ClassNameTypeResolver classNameTypeResolver = new ClassNameTypeResolver();
classNameTypeResolver.setClassNameExtractor((klass) -> {
	// Implement Custom ClassName Extractor here
});
builder.defaultTypeResolver(classNameTypeResolver);
----

The <<execution-graphqlsource, GraphQlSource section>> explains how to configure that with Spring Boot.

[[execution-graphqlsource-operation-caching]]
==== Operation Caching

GraphQL Java must _parse_ and _validate_ an operation before executing it. This may impact
performance significantly. To avoid the need to re-parse and validate, an application may
configure a `PreparsedDocumentProvider` that caches and reuses Document instances. The
{graphql-java-docs}/execution/#query-caching[GraphQL Java docs] provide more details on
query caching through a `PreparsedDocumentProvider`.

In Spring GraphQL you can register a `PreparsedDocumentProvider` through
`GraphQlSource.Builder#configureGraphQl`:
.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
// Typically, accessed through Spring Boot's GraphQlSourceBuilderCustomizer
GraphQlSource.Builder builder = ...

// Create provider
PreparsedDocumentProvider provider = ...

builder.schemaResources(..)
		.configureRuntimeWiring(..)
		.configureGraphQl(graphQLBuilder -> graphQLBuilder.preparsedDocumentProvider(provider))
----

The <<execution-graphqlsource, GraphQlSource section>> explains how to configure that with Spring Boot.

[[execution-graphqlsource-directives]]
==== Directives

The GraphQL language supports directives that "describe alternate runtime execution and
type validation behavior in a GraphQL document". Directives are similar to annotations in
Java but declared on types, fields, fragments and operations in a GraphQL document.

GraphQL Java provides the `SchemaDirectiveWiring` contract to help applications detect
and handle directives. For more details, see
{graphql-java-docs}/sdl-directives/[Schema Directives] in the
GraphQL Java documentation.

In Spring GraphQL you can register a `SchemaDirectiveWiring` through a
<<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>>. The Spring Boot starter detects
such beans, so you might have something like:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Configuration
public class GraphQlConfig {

    @Bean
    public RuntimeWiringConfigurer runtimeWiringConfigurer() {
        return builder -> builder.directiveWiring(new MySchemaDirectiveWiring());
    }

}
----

TIP: For an example of directives support check out the
https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-extended-validation[Extended Validation for Graphql Java]
library.



[[execution-reactive-datafetcher]]
=== Reactive `DataFetcher`

The default `GraphQlSource` builder enables support for a `DataFetcher` to return `Mono`
or `Flux` which adapts those to a `CompletableFuture` where `Flux` values are aggregated
and turned into a List, unless the request is a GraphQL subscription request,
in which case the return value remains a Reactive Streams `Publisher` for streaming
GraphQL responses.

A reactive `DataFetcher` can rely on access to Reactor context propagated from the
transport layer, such as from a WebFlux request handling, see
<<execution-context-webflux, WebFlux Context>>.



[[execution-context]]
=== Context Propagation

Spring for GraphQL provides support to transparently propagate context from the
<<web-transports>>, through GraphQL Java, and to `DataFetcher` and other components it
invokes. This includes both `ThreadLocal` context from the Spring MVC request handling
thread and Reactor `Context` from the WebFlux processing pipeline.


[[execution-context-webmvc]]
==== WebMvc

A `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by GraphQL Java may not always execute on
the same thread as the Spring MVC handler, for example if an asynchronous
<<web-interception, `WebGraphQlHandlerInterceptor`>> or `DataFetcher` switches to a
different thread.

Spring for GraphQL supports propagating `ThreadLocal` values from the Servlet container
thread to the thread a `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by GraphQL Java to
execute on. To do this, an application needs to create a `ThreadLocalAccessor` to extract
`ThreadLocal` values of interest:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class RequestAttributesAccessor implements ThreadLocalAccessor {

	private static final String KEY = RequestAttributesAccessor.class.getName();

	@Override
	public void extractValues(Map<String, Object> container) {
		container.put(KEY, RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes());
	}

	@Override
	public void restoreValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		if (values.containsKey(KEY)) {
			RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes((RequestAttributes) values.get(KEY));
		}
	}

	@Override
	public void resetValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		RequestContextHolder.resetRequestAttributes();
	}

}
----

A `ThreadLocalAccessor` can be registered in the <<web-interception,WebGraphHandler>>
builder. The Boot starter detects beans of this type and automatically registers them for
Spring MVC application, see the
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.web-endpoints[Web Endpoints] section.


[[execution-context-webflux]]
==== WebFlux

A <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>> can rely on access to Reactor context that
originates from the WebFlux request handling chain. This includes Reactor context
added by <<web-interception, WebGraphQlHandlerInterceptor>> components.



[[execution-exceptions]]
=== Exception Resolution

GraphQL Java applications can register a `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` to decide how to
represent exceptions from the data layer in the "errors" section of the GraphQL response.

Spring for GraphQL has a built-in `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` that is configured for use
by the <<execution-graphqlsource>> builder. It enables applications to register one or
more Spring `DataFetcherExceptionResolver` components that are invoked sequentially
until one resolves the `Exception` to a list of `graphql.GraphQLError` objects.

`DataFetcherExceptionResolver` is an asynchronous contract. For most implementations, it
would be sufficient to extend `DataFetcherExceptionResolverAdapter` and override
one of its `resolveToSingleError` or `resolveToMultipleErrors` methods that
resolve exceptions synchronously.

A `GraphQLError` can be assigned an `graphql.ErrorClassification`. Spring for GraphQL
defines an `ErrorType` enum with common, error classification categories:

- `BAD_REQUEST`
- `UNAUTHORIZED`
- `FORBIDDEN`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

Applications can use this to classify errors. If an error remains unresolved, by
default it is marked as `INTERNAL_ERROR`.



[[execution-batching]]
=== Batch Loading

Given a `Book` and its `Author`, we can create one `DataFetcher` for a book and another
for its author. This allows selecting books with or without authors, but it means books
and authors aren't loaded together, which is especially inefficient when querying multiple
books as the author for each book is loaded individually. This is known as the N+1 select
problem.


[[execution-batching-dataloader]]
==== `DataLoader`

GraphQL Java provides a `DataLoader` mechanism for batch loading of related entities.
You can find the full details in the
{graphql-java-docs}/batching/[GraphQL Java docs]. Below is a
summary of how it works:

 1. Register ``DataLoader``'s in the `DataLoaderRegistry` that can load entities, given unique keys.
 2. ``DataFetcher``'s can access ``DataLoader``'s and use them to load entities by id.
 3. A `DataLoader` defers loading by returning a future so it can be done in a batch.
 4. ``DataLoader``'s maintain a per request cache of loaded entities that can further
 improve efficiency.


[[execution-batching-batch-loader-registry]]
==== `BatchLoaderRegistry`

The complete batching loading mechanism in GraphQL Java requires implementing one of
several `BatchLoader` interface, then wrapping and registering those as ``DataLoader``s
with a name in the `DataLoaderRegistry`.

The API in Spring GraphQL is slightly different. For registration, there is only one,
central `BatchLoaderRegistry` exposing factory methods and a builder to create and
register any number of batch loading functions:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Configuration
public class MyConfig {

	public MyConfig(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {

		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerMappedBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
            // return Mono<Map<Long, Author>
        });

        // more registrations ...
    }

}
----

The Spring Boot starter declares a `BatchLoaderRegistry` bean that you can inject into
your configuration, as shown above, or into any component such as a controller in order
register batch loading functions. In turn the `BatchLoaderRegistry` is injected into
`DefaultExecutionGraphQlService` where it ensures `DataLoader` registrations per request.

By default, the `DataLoader` name is based on the class name of the target entity.
This allows an `@SchemaMapping` method to declare a
<<controllers-schema-mapping-data-loader,DataLoader argument>> with a generic type, and
without the need for specifying a name. The name, however, can be customized through the
`BatchLoaderRegistry` builder, if necessary, along with other `DataLoader` options.

For many cases, when loading related entities, you can use
<<controllers-batch-mapping,@BatchMapping>> controller methods, which are a shortcut
for and replace the need to use `BatchLoaderRegistry` and `DataLoader` directly.
s
`BatchLoaderRegistry` provides other important benefits too. It supports access to
the same `GraphQLContext` from batch loading functions and from `@BatchMapping` methods,
as well as ensures <<execution-context>> to them. This is why applications are expected
to use it. It is possible to perform your own `DataLoader` registrations directly but
such registrations would forgo the above benefits.


[[execution-batching-testing]]
==== Testing Batch Loading

Start by having `BatchLoaderRegistry` perform registrations on a `DataLoaderRegistry`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
BatchLoaderRegistry batchLoaderRegistry = new DefaultBatchLoaderRegistry();
// perform registrations...

DataLoaderRegistry dataLoaderRegistry = DataLoaderRegistry.newRegistry().build();
batchLoaderRegistry.registerDataLoaders(dataLoaderRegistry, graphQLContext);
----

Now you can access and test individual ``DataLoader``'s as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
DataLoader<Long, Book> loader = dataLoaderRegistry.getDataLoader(Book.class.getName());
loader.load(1L);
loader.loadMany(Arrays.asList(2L, 3L));
List<Book> books = loader.dispatchAndJoin(); // actual loading

assertThat(books).hasSize(3);
assertThat(books.get(0).getName()).isEqualTo("...");
// ...
----




[[data]]
== Data Integration

Spring for GraphQL lets you leverage existing Spring technology, following common
programming models to expose underlying data sources through GraphQL.

This section discusses an integration layer for Spring Data that provides an easy way to
adapt a Querydsl or a Query by Example repository to a `DataFetcher`, including the
option for automated detection and GraphQL Query registration for repositories marked
with `@GraphQlRepository`.



[[data-querydsl]]
=== Querydsl

Spring for GraphQL supports use of http://www.querydsl.com/[Querydsl] to fetch data through
the Spring Data
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#core.extensions[Querydsl extension].
Querydsl provides a flexible yet typesafe approach to express query predicates by
generating a meta-model using annotation processors.

For example, declare a repository as `QuerydslPredicateExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QuerydslPredicateExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Then use it to create a `DataFetcher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();
----

You can now register the above `DataFetcher` through a
<<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>>.

The `DataFetcher` builds a Querydsl `Predicate` from GraphQL request parameters, and
uses it to fetch data. Spring Data supports `QuerydslPredicateExecutor` for JPA,
MongoDB, and LDAP.

If the repository is `ReactiveQuerydslPredicateExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB.


[[data-querydsl-build]]
==== Build Setup

To configure Querydsl in your build, follow the
https://querydsl.com/static/querydsl/latest/reference/html/ch02.html[official reference documentation]:

For example:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="primary"]
.Gradle
----
dependencies {
	//...

	annotationProcessor "com.querydsl:querydsl-apt:$querydslVersion:jpa",
            'org.hibernate.javax.persistence:hibernate-jpa-2.1-api:1.0.2.Final',
            'javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.2'
}

compileJava {
    options.annotationProcessorPath = configurations.annotationProcessor
}
----
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Maven
----
<dependencies>
	<!-- ... -->

				</configuration>
			</execution>
		</executions>
	</plugin>
</plugins>
----

The {github-main-branch}/samples/webmvc-http[webmvc-http] sample uses Querydsl for
`artifactRepositories`.


[[data-querydsl-customizations]]
==== Customizations

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports customizing how GraphQL arguments are bound onto properties
to create a Querydsl `Predicate`. By default, arguments are bound as "is equal to" for
each available property. To customize that, you can use `QuerydslDataFetcher` builder
methods to provide a `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`.

A repository may itself be an instance of `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`. This is auto-detected
and transparently applied during <<data-querydsl-registration>>. However, when manually
building a `QuerydslDataFetcher` you will need to use builder methods to apply it.

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports interface and DTO projections to transform query results
before returning these for further GraphQL processing.

TIP: To learn what projections are, please refer to the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[Spring Data docs].
To understand how to use projections in GraphQL, please see <<data-projections>>.

To use Spring Data projections with Querydsl repositories, create either a projection interface
or a target DTO class and configure it through the `projectAs` method to obtain a
`DataFetcher` producing the target type:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class Account {

		String name, identifier, description;

		Person owner;
	}

	interface AccountProjection {

		String getName();

		String getIdentifier();
	}

	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<AccountProjection> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<AccountProjection>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).many();
----



[[data-querydsl-registration]]
==== Auto-Registration

If a repository is annotated with `@GraphQlRepository`, it is automatically registered
for queries that do not already have a registered `DataFetcher` and whose return type
matches that of the repository domain type. This includes both single value and multi-value
queries.

By default, the name of the GraphQL type returned by the query must match the simple name
of the repository domain type. If needed, you can use the `typeName` attribute of
`@GraphQlRepository` to specify the target GraphQL type name.

Auto-registration detects if a given repository implements `QuerydslBinderCustomizer` and
transparently applies that through `QuerydslDataFetcher` builder methods.

Auto-registration is performed through a built-in `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` that can be
obtained from `QuerydslDataFetcher`. The
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.data-query[Boot starter] automatically
detects `@GraphQlRepository` beans and uses them to initialize the
`RuntimeWiringConfigurer` with.

Auto-registration does not support <<data-querybyexample-customizations, customizations>>.
If you need that, you'll need to use `QueryByExampleDataFetcher` to build and
register the `DataFetcher` manually through a
<<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>>.



[[data-querybyexample]]
=== Query by Example

Spring Data supports the use of
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#query-by-example[Query by Example]
to fetch data. Query by Example (QBE) is a simple querying technique that does not require
you to write queries through store-specific query languages.

Start by declaring a repository that is `QueryByExampleExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QueryByExampleExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Use `QueryByExampleDataFetcher` to turn the repository into a `DataFecher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();
----

You can now register the above `DataFetcher` through a
<<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>>.

The `DataFetcher` uses the GraphQL arguments map to create the domain type of the
repository and use that as the example object to fetch data with. Spring Data supports
`QueryByExampleDataFetcher` for JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis.

If the repository is `ReactiveQueryByExampleExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis, and R2dbc.


[[data-querybyexample-build]]
==== Build Setup

Query by Example is already included in the Spring Data modules for the data stores where
it is supported, so no extra setup is required to enable it.


[[data-querybyexample-customizations]]
==== Customizations

`QueryByExampleDataFetcher` supports interface and DTO projections to transform query
results before returning these for further GraphQL processing.

TIP: To learn what projections are, please refer to the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[Spring Data documentation].
To understand the role of projections in GraphQL, please see <<data-projections>>.

To use Spring Data projections with Query by Example repositories, create either a projection interface
or a target DTO class and configure it through the `projectAs` method to obtain a
`DataFetcher` producing the target type:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class Account {

		String name, identifier, description;

		Person owner;
	}

	interface AccountProjection {

		String getName();

		String getIdentifier();
	}

	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<AccountProjection> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<AccountProjection>> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).many();
----


[[data-querybyexample-registration]]
==== Auto-Registration

If a repository is annotated with `@GraphQlRepository`, it is automatically registered
for queries that do not already have a registered `DataFetcher` and whose return type
matches that of the repository domain type. This includes both single value and multi-value
queries.

By default, the name of the GraphQL type returned by the query must match the simple name
of the repository domain type. If needed, you can use the `typeName` attribute of
`@GraphQlRepository` to specify the target GraphQL type name.

Auto-registration is performed through a built-in `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` that can be
obtained from `QueryByExampleDataFetcher`. The
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.data-query[Boot starter] automatically
detects `@GraphQlRepository` beans and uses them to initialize the
`RuntimeWiringConfigurer` with.

Auto-registration does not support <<data-querybyexample-customizations, customizations>>.
If you need that, you'll need to use `QueryByExampleDataFetcher` to build and
register the `DataFetcher` manually through a
<<execution-graphqlsource-runtimewiring-configurer>>.



[[data-projections]]
=== Selection Set vs Projections

A common question that arises is, how GraphQL selection sets compare to
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[Spring Data projections]
and what role does each play?

The short answer is that Spring for GraphQL is not a data gateway that translates GraphQL
queries directly into SQL or JSON queries. Instead, it lets you leverage existing Spring
technology and does not assume a one for one mapping between the GraphQL schema and the
underlying data model. That is why client-driven selection and server-side transformation
of the data model can play complementary roles.

To better understand, consider that Spring Data promotes domain-driven (DDD) design as
the recommended approach to manage complexity in the data layer. In DDD, it is important
to adhere to the constraints of an aggregate. By definition an aggregate is valid only if
loaded in its entirety, since a partially loaded aggregate may impose limitations on
aggregate functionality.

In Spring Data you can choose whether you want your aggregate be exposed as is, or
whether to apply transformations to the data model before returning it as a GraphQL
result. Sometimes it's enough to do the former, and by default the
<<data-querydsl>> and the <<data-querybyexample>> integrations turn the GraphQL
selection set into property path hints that the underlying Spring Data module uses to
limit the selection.

In other cases, it's useful to reduce or even transform the underlying data model in
order to adapt to the GraphQL schema. Spring Data supports this through Interface
and DTO Projections.

Interface projections define a fixed set of properties to expose where properties may or
may not be `null`, depending on the data store query result. There are two kinds of
interface projections both of which determine what properties to load from the underlying
data source:

- https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.interfaces.closed[Closed interface projections]
are helpful if you cannot partially materialize the aggregate object, but you still
want to expose a subset of properties.
- https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.interfaces.open[Open interface projections]
leverage Spring's `@Value` annotation and
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/core.html#expressions[SpEL]  expressions to apply lightweight
data transformations, such as concatenations, computations, or applying static functions
to a property.

DTO projections offer a higher level of customization as you can place transformation
code either in the constructor or in getter methods.

DTO projections materialize from a query where the individual properties are
determined by the projection itself. DTO projections are commonly used with full-args
constructors (e.g. Java records), and therefore they can only be constructed if all
required fields (or columns) are part of the database query result.




[[controllers]]
== Annotated Controllers

Spring for GraphQL provides an annotation-based programming model where `@Controller`
components use annotations to declare handler methods with flexible method signatures to
fetch the data for specific GraphQL fields. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class GreetingController {

			@QueryMapping // <1>
			public String hello() { // <2>
				return "Hello, world!";
			}

	}
----
<1> Bind this method to a query, i.e. a field under the Query type.
<2> Determine the query from the method name if not declared on the annotation.

Spring for GraphQL uses `RuntimeWiring.Builder` to register the above handler method as a
`graphql.schema.DataFetcher` for the query named "hello".


[[controllers-declaration]]
=== Declaration

You can define `@Controller` beans as standard Spring bean definitions. The
`@Controller` stereotype allows for auto-detection, aligned with Spring general
support for detecting `@Controller` and `@Component` classes on the classpath and
auto-registering bean definitions for them. It also acts as a stereotype for the annotated
class, indicating its role as a data fetching component in a GraphQL application.

`AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` detects `@Controller` beans and registers their
annotated handler methods as ``DataFetcher``s via `RuntimeWiring.Builder`. It is an
implementation of `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` which can be added to `GraphQlSource.Builder`.
The Spring Boot starter automatically declares `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` as a bean
and adds all `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` beans to `GraphQlSource.Builder` and that enables
support for annotated ``DataFetcher``s, see the
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/web.html#web.graphql.runtimewiring[GraphQL RuntimeWiring] section
in the Boot starter documentation.


[[controllers-schema-mapping]]
=== `@SchemaMapping`

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation maps a handler method to a field in the GraphQL schema
and declares it to be the `DataFetcher` for that field. The annotation can specify the
parent type name, and the field name:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book", field="author")
		public Author getAuthor(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can also leave out those attributes, in which case the
field name defaults to the method name, while the type name defaults to the simple class
name of the source/parent object injected into the method. For example, the below
defaults to type "Book" and field "author":

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can be declared at the class level to specify a default
type name for all handler methods in the class.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book")
	public class BookController {

		// @SchemaMapping methods for fields of the "Book" type

	}
----

`@QueryMapping`, `@MutationMapping`, and `@SubscriptionMapping` are meta annotations that
are themselves annotated with `@SchemaMapping` and have the typeName preset to `Query`,
`Mutation`, or `Subscription` respectively. Effectively, these are shortcut annotations
for fields under the Query, Mutation, and Subscription types respectively. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}

		@SubscriptionMapping
		public Flux<Book> newPublications() {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

`@SchemaMapping` handler methods have flexible signatures and can choose from a range of
method arguments and return values..


[[controllers-schema-mapping-signature]]
==== Method Signature

Schema mapping handler methods can have any of the following method arguments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Method Argument | Description

| `@Argument`
| For access to a named field argument bound to a higher-level, typed Object.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-argument>>.

| `@Arguments`
| For access to all field arguments bound to a higher-level, typed Object.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-arguments>>.

| `@ProjectedPayload` Interface
| For access to field arguments through a project interface.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-projectedpayload-argument>>.

| Source
| For access to the source (i.e. parent/container) instance of the field.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-source>>.

| `DataLoader`
| For access to a `DataLoader` in the `DataLoaderRegistry`.
See <<controllers-schema-mapping-data-loader>>.

| `@ContextValue`
| For access to a value from the localContext, if it is an instance of `GraphQLContext`,
  or from the `GraphQLContext` of `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `GraphQLContext`
| For access to the context from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Obtained from the Spring Security context, if available.

| `@AuthenticationPrincipal`
| For access to `Authentication#getPrincipal()` from the Spring Security context.

| `DataFetchingFieldSelectionSet`
| For access to the selection set for the query through the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `Locale`, `Optional<Locale>`
| For access to the `Locale` from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `DataFetchingEnvironment`
| For direct access to the underlying `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

|===

Schema mapping handler methods can return any value, including Reactor `Mono` and
`Flux` as described in <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>>.



[[controllers-schema-mapping-argument]]
==== `@Argument`

In GraphQL Java, `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to a map of field-specific
argument values. The values can be simple scalar values (e.g. String, Long), a `Map` of
values for more complex input, or a `List` of values.

Use the `@Argument` annotation to have an argument bound to a target object and
injected into the handler method. Binding is performed by mapping argument values to a
primary data constructor of the expected method parameter type, or by using a default
constructor to create the object and then map argument values to its properties. This is
repeated recursively, using all nested argument values and creating nested target objects
accordingly. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

By default, if the method parameter name is available (requires the `-parameters` compiler
flag with Java 8+ or debugging info from the compiler), it is used to look up the argument.
If needed, you can customize the name through the annotation, e.g. `@Argument("bookInput")`.

TIP: The `@Argument` annotation does not have a "required" flag, nor the option to
specify a default value. Both of these can be specified at the GraphQL schema level and
are enforced by GraphQL Java.

If binding fails, a `BindException` is raised with binding issues accumulated as field
errors where the `field` of each error is the argument path where the issue occurred.

You can use `@Argument` on a `Map<String, Object>` argument, to obtain all argument
values. The name attribute on `@Argument` must not be set.


[[controllers-schema-mapping-arguments]]
==== `@Arguments`

Use the `@Arguments` annotation, if you want to bind the full arguments map onto a single
target Object, in contrast to `@Argument`, which binds a specific, named argument.

For example, `@Argument BookInput bookInput` uses the value of the argument "bookInput"
to initialize `BookInput`, while `@Arguments` uses the full arguments map and in that
case, top-level arguments are bound to `BookInput` properties.



[[controllers-schema-mapping-validation]]
==== `@Argument(s)` Validation

If a {spring-framework-ref-docs}/core.html#validation-beanvalidation-overview[Bean Validation]
`Validator` (or typically, a `LocalValidatorFactoryBean`) bean is present in the application context,
the `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` will auto-detect it and configure support for validation.
Controller arguments annotated with `@Valid` and `@Validated` are then validated before method invocation.

Bean Validation lets you declare constraints on types, as the following example shows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class BookInput {

    @NotNull
    private String title;

	@NotNull
    @Size(max=13)
    private String isbn;
}
----

We can then mark our argument for validation with `@Valid`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument @Valid BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

If an error occurs during validation, a `ConstraintViolationException` is thrown and can be
later <<execution-exceptions,resolved with a custom `DataFetcherExceptionResolver`>>.

[TIP]
====
Unlike Spring MVC, handler method signatures do not support the injection of `BindingResult`
for reacting to validation errors: those are globally dealt with as exceptions.
====


[[controllers-schema-mapping-projectedpayload-argument]]
==== `@ProjectedPayload` Interface

As an alternative to using complete Objects with <<controllers-schema-mapping-argument>>,
you can also use a projection interface to access GraphQL request arguments through a
well-defined, minimal interface. Argument projections are provided by
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.interfaces[Spring Data's Interface projections]
when Spring Data is on the class path.

To make use of this, create an interface annotated with `@ProjectedPayload` and declare
it as a controller method parameter. If the parameter is annotated with `@Argument`,
it applies to an individual argument within the `DataFetchingEnvironment.getArguments()`
map. When declared without `@Argument`, the projection works on top-level arguments in
the complete arguments map.

For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(BookIdProjection bookId) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInputProjection bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}

	@ProjectedPayload
	interface BookIdProjection {

		Long getId();
	}

	@ProjectedPayload
	interface BookInputProjection {

		String getName();

		@Value("#{target.author + ' ' + target.name}")
		String getAuthorAndName();
	}
----


[[controllers-schema-mapping-source]]
==== Source

In GraphQL Java, the `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to the source (i.e.
parent/container) instance of the field. To access this, simply declare a method parameter
of the expected target type.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The source method argument also helps to determine the type name for the mapping.
If the simple name of the Java class matches the GraphQL type, then there is no need to
explicitly specify the type name in the `@SchemaMapping` annotation.

[TIP]
====
A <<controllers-batch-mapping>> handler method can batch load all authors for a query,
given a list of source/parent books objects.
====


[[controllers-schema-mapping-data-loader]]
==== `DataLoader`

When you register a batch loading function for an entity, as explained in
<<execution-batching>>, you can access the `DataLoader` for the entity by declaring a
method argument of type `DataLoader` and use it to load the entity:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	public BookController(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {
		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerMappedBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
			// return Map<Long, Author>
		});
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	public CompletableFuture<Author> author(Book book, DataLoader<Long, Author> loader) {
		return loader.load(book.getAuthorId());
	}

}
----

By default, `BatchLoaderRegistry` uses the full class name of the value type (e.g. the
class name for `Author`) for the key of the registration, and therefore simply declaring
the `DataLoader` method argument with generic types provides enough information
to locate it in the `DataLoaderRegistry`. As a fallback, the `DataLoader` method argument
resolver will also try the method argument name as the key but typically that should not
be necessary.

Note that for many cases with loading related entities, where the `@SchemaMapping` simply
delegates to a `DataLoader`, you can reduce boilerplate by using a
<<controllers-batch-mapping,@BatchMapping>> method as described in the next section.



[[controllers-batch-mapping]]
=== `@BatchMapping`

<<execution-batching>> addresses the N+1 select problem through the use of an
`org.dataloader.DataLoader` to defer the loading of individual entity instances, so they
can be loaded together. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	public BookController(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {
		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerMappedBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
			// return Map<Long, Author>
		});
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	public CompletableFuture<Author> author(Book book, DataLoader<Long, Author> loader) {
		return loader.load(book.getAuthorId());
	}

}
----

For the straight-forward case of loading an associated entity, shown above, the
`@SchemaMapping` method does nothing more than delegate to the `DataLoader`. This is
boilerplate that can be avoided with a `@BatchMapping` method. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@BatchMapping
		public Mono<Map<Book, Author>> author(List<Book> books) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The above becomes a batch loading function in the `BatchLoaderRegistry`
where keys are `Book` instances and the loaded values their authors. In addition, a
`DataFetcher` is also transparently bound to the `author` field of the type `Book`, which
simply delegates to the `DataLoader` for authors, given its source/parent `Book` instance.

[TIP]
====
To be used as a unique key, `Book` must implement `hashcode` and `equals`.
====

By default, the field name defaults to the method name, while the type name defaults to
the simple class name of the input `List` element type. Both can be customized through
annotation attributes. The type name can also be inherited from a class level
`@SchemaMapping`.


[[controllers-batch-mapping-signature]]
==== Method Signature

Batch mapping methods support the following arguments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Method Argument | Description

| `List<K>`
| The source/parent objects.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Obtained from Spring Security context, if available.

| `@ContextValue`
| For access to a value from the `GraphQLContext` of `BatchLoaderEnvironment`,
  which is the same context as the one from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `GraphQLContext`
| For access to the context from the `BatchLoaderEnvironment`,
  which is the same context as the one from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `BatchLoaderEnvironment`
| The environment that is available in GraphQL Java to a
`org.dataloader.BatchLoaderWithContext`.


|===

Batch mapping methods can return:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Return Type | Description

| `Mono<Map<K,V>>`
| A map with parent objects as keys, and batch loaded objects as values.

| `Flux<V>`
| A sequence of batch loaded objects that must be in the same order as the source/parent
  objects passed into the method.

| `Map<K,V>`, `List<V>`
| Imperative variants, e.g. without remote calls to make.

|===




[[security]]
== Security

The path to a <<web-transports, Web>> GraphQL endpoint can be secured with HTTP
URL security to ensure that only authenticated users can access it. This does not,
however, differentiate among different GraphQL requests on such a shared endpoint on
a single URL.

To apply more fine-grained security, add Spring Security annotations such as
`@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` to service methods involved in fetching specific parts of
the GraphQL response. This should work due to <<execution-context>> that aims to make
Security, and other context, available at the data fetching level.
