[[overview]]
== Overview

Spring GraphQL provides support for Spring applications built on
https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java]. It is a joint collaboration between both
teams. Our shared philosophy is to be less opinionated and more focused on
comprehensive and wide-ranging support.

Spring GraphQL is the successor of the
https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-spring[GraphQL Java Spring] project from
the GraphQL Java team. It aims to be the foundation for all Spring, GraphQL applications.

The project is in a milestone phase towards a 1.0 release, currently, and looking for
feedback. Please, use our
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql/issues[issue tracker] to report a
problem, discuss a design issue, or request a feature.

To get started, please see the <<boot-graphql>> and the <<samples>> sections.



[[web-transports]]
== Web Transports

Spring GraphQL supports GraphQL requests over HTTP and over WebSocket.



[[web-http]]
=== HTTP

`GraphQlHttpHandler` handles GraphQL over HTTP requests and delegates to the
<<web-interception>> chain for request execution. There are two variants, one for
Spring MVC and one for Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have
equivalent functionality, but rely on blocking vs non-blocking I/O respectively for
writing the HTTP response.

Requests must use HTTP POST with GraphQL request details included as JSON in the
request body, as defined in the proposed
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md[GraphQL over HTTP]
specification. Once the JSON body has been successfully decoded, the HTTP response
status is always 200 (OK), and any errors from GraphQL request execution appear in the
"errors" section of the GraphQL response.

`GraphQlHttpHandler` can be exposed as an HTTP endpoint by declaring a `RouterFunction`
bean and using the `RouterFunctions` from Spring MVC or WebFlux to create the route. The
Boot starter does this, see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details or check
`GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains a Spring MVC
{repository}/samples/webmvc-http[HTTP sample] application.



[[web-websocket]]
=== WebSocket

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` handles GraphQL over WebSocket requests based on the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md[protocol] defined in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The main reason to use
GraphQL over WebSocket is subscriptions which allow sending a stream of GraphQL
responses, but it can also be used for regular queries with a single response.
The handler delegates every request to the <<web-interception>> chain for further
request execution.

[TIP]
.GraphQL Over WebSocket Protocols
====
There are two such protocols, one in the
https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws[subscriptions-transport-ws]
library and another in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The former is not active and
succeeded by the latter. Read this
https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-over-websockets[blog post] for the history.
====

There are two variants of `GraphQlWebSocketHandler`, one for Spring MVC and one for
Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have equivalent functionality.
The WebFlux handler also uses non-blocking I/O and back pressure to stream messages,
which works well since in GraphQL Java a subscription response is a Reactive Streams
`Publisher`.

The `graphql-ws` project lists a number of
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws#recipes[recipes] for client use.

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` can be exposed as a WebSocket endpoint by declaring a
`SimpleUrlHandlerMapping` bean and using it to map the handler to a URL path. The Boot
starter has options to enable this, see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details or check
`GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains a WebFlux
{repository}/samples/webflux-websocket[WebSocket sample] application.



[[web-interception]]
=== Web Interception

<<web-http>> and <<web-websocket>> transport handlers delegate to a common Web
interception chain for request execution. The chain consists of a sequence of
`WebInterceptor` components, followed by a `GraphQlService` that invokes the GraphQL
Java engine.

`WebInterceptor` is as a common contract to use in both Spring MVC and WebFlux
applications. Use it to intercept requests, inspect HTTP request headers, or to register a
transformation of the `graphql.ExecutionInput`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebOutput> intercept(WebInput webInput, WebGraphQlHandler next) {
		webInput.configureExecutionInput((executionInput, builder) -> {
			Map<String, Object> map = ... ;
			return builder.extensions(map).build();
		});
		return next.handle(webInput);
	}
}
----

Use `WebInterceptor` also to intercept responses, add HTTP response headers, or transform
the `graphql.ExecutionResult`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebOutput> intercept(WebInput webInput, WebGraphQlHandler next) {
		return next.handle(webInput)
				.map(webOutput -> {
					Object data = webOutput.getData();
					Object updatedData = ... ;
					return webOutput.transform(builder -> builder.data(updatedData));
				});
	}
}
----

`WebGraphQlHandler` provides a builder to initialize the Web interception chain. After
you build the chain, you can use the resulting `WebGraphQlHandler` to initialize the HTTP
or WebSocket transport handlers. The Boot starter configures all this,
see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details, or check `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or
`GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.




[[execution]]
== Query Execution

`GraphQlService` is the main Spring GraphQL abstraction to call GraphQL Java to execute
requests. Underlying transports, such as the <<web-transports>>, delegate to `GraphQlService` to
handle requests.

The main implementation, `ExecutionGraphQlService`, is a thin facade around the
invocation of `graphql.GraphQL`. It is configured with a `GraphQlSource` for access to
the `graphql.GraphQL` instance.



[[execution-graphqlsource]]
=== `GraphQLSource`

`GraphQlSource` is a core Spring GraphQL abstraction for access to the
`graphql.GraphQL` instance to use for request execution. It provides a builder API to
initialize GraphQL Java and build a `GraphQlSource`.

The default `GraphQlSource` builder, accessible via `GraphQlSource.builder()`, enables
support for <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>>, <<execution-context>>, and
<<execution-exceptions>>.



[[execution-reactive-datafetcher]]
=== Reactive `DataFetcher`

The default `GraphQlSource` builder enables support for a `DataFetcher` to return `Mono`
or `Flux`. Both return types are adapted to a `CompletableFuture` with `Flux` values
aggregated and turned into a List, unless the request is a GraphQL subscription request,
in which case the return value remains a Reactive Streams `Publisher` for streaming
GraphQL responses.

A reactive `DataFetcher` can rely on access to Reactor context propagated from the
transport layer, such as from a WebFlux request handling, see
<<execution-context-webflux, WebFlux Context>>.



[[execution-context]]
=== Context Propagation

Spring GraphQL provides support to transparently propagate context from the <<web-transports>>,
through the GraphQL engine, and to `DataFetcher` and other components it invokes.
This includes both `ThreadLocal` context from the Spring MVC request handling thread and
Reactor `Context` from the WebFlux processing pipeline.


[[execution-context-webmvc]]
==== WebMvc

A `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by GraphQL Java may not always execute on
the same thread as the Spring MVC handler, for example if an asynchronous
<<web-interception, `WebInterceptor`>> or `DataFetcher` switches to a different thread.

Spring GraphQL supports propagating `ThreadLocal` values from the Servlet container
thread to the thread a `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by the GraphQL engine
execute on. To do this, an application needs to create a `ThreadLocalAccessor` to extract
`ThreadLocal` values of interest:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class RequestAttributesAccessor implements ThreadLocalAccessor {

	private static final String KEY = RequestAttributesAccessor.class.getName();

	@Override
	public void extractValues(Map<String, Object> container) {
		container.put(KEY, RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes());
	}

	@Override
	public void restoreValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		if (values.containsKey(KEY)) {
			RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes((RequestAttributes) values.get(KEY));
		}
	}

	@Override
	public void resetValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		RequestContextHolder.resetRequestAttributes();
	}

}
----

A `ThreadLocalAccessor` can be registered in the <<web-interception,WebGraphHandler>>
builder. The Boot starter detects beans of this type and automatically registers them for
Spring MVC application, see <<boot-graphql-web>>.


[[execution-context-webflux]]
==== WebFlux

A <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>> can rely on access to Reactor context that
originates from the WebFlux request handling chain. This includes Reactor context
added by <<web-interception, WebInterceptor>> components.



[[execution-exceptions]]
=== Exception Resolution

GraphQL Java applications can register a `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` to decide how to
represent exceptions from the data layer in the "errors" section of the GraphQL response.

Spring GraphQL has a built-in `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` that is configured for use
by the <<execution-graphqlsource>> builder. It enables applications to register one or
more Spring `DataFetcherExceptionResolver` components that are invoked sequentially
until one resolves the `Exception` to a list of `graphql.GraphQLError` objects.

`DataFetcherExceptionResolver` is an asynchronous contract. For most implementations, it
would be sufficient to extend `DataFetcherExceptionResolverAdapter` and override
one of its `resolveToSingleError` or `resolveToMultipleErrors` methods that
resolve exceptions synchronously.

A `GraphQLError` can be assigned an `graphql.ErrorClassification`. Spring GraphQL
defines an `ErrorType` enum with common, error classification categories:

- `BAD_REQUEST`
- `UNAUTHORIZED`
- `FORBIDDEN`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

Applications can use this to classify errors. If an error remains unresolved, by
default it is marked as `INTERNAL_ERROR`.




[[data]]
== Data Integration

[[data-querydsl]]
=== Querydsl

Spring GraphQL supports use of http://www.querydsl.com/[Querydsl] to fetch data through
the Spring Data
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#core.extensions[Querydsl extension].
Querydsl provides a flexible yet typesafe approach to express query predicates by
generating a meta-model using annotation processors.

For example, declare a repository as `QuerydslPredicateExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QuerydslPredicateExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Then use it to create a `DataFetcher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    // For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

    // For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();
----

The `DataFetcher` builds a Querydsl `Predicate` from GraphQL request parameters, and
uses it to fetch data. Spring Data supports `QuerydslPredicateExecutor` for JPA,
MongoDB, and LDAP.

If the repository is `ReactiveQuerydslPredicateExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB.

The Querydsl integration allows customizing the request parameters binding onto a
`Predicate` by accepting a `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`. Request parameters are bound
by default as "is equal to" for each available property in the request.

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[interface and DTO projections]
to transform query results before returning these for further GraphQL processing.

The {repository}/samples/webmvc-http[webmvc-http] sample in the Spring GraphQL repository
uses Querydsl to fetch `artifactRepositories`.




[[data-security]]
== Security

The path to a <<web-transports, Web>> GraphQL endpoint can be secured with HTTP
URL security to ensure that only authenticated users can access it. This does not,
however, differentiate among different GraphQL requests on such a shared endpoint on
a single URL.

To apply more fine-grained security, add Spring Security annotations such as
`@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` to service methods involved in fetching specific parts of
the GraphQL response. This should work due to <<execution-context>> that aims to make
Security, and other context, available at the data fetching level.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains samples for
{repository}/samples/webmvc-http-security[Spring MVC] and for
{repository}/samples/webflux-security[WebFlux].




[[testing]]
== Testing

You can test GraphQL requests using Spring's `WebTestClient`, just send and receive
JSON, but a number of GraphQL specific details make this approach more cumbersome than it
should be.



[[testing-graphqltester]]
=== `GraphQlTester`

`GraphQlTester` defines a workflow to test GraphQL requests with the following benefits:

- Verify GraphQL responses are 200 (OK).
- Verify no unexpected errors under the "errors" key in the response.
- Decode under the "data" key in the response.
- Use JsonPath to decode different parts of the response.
- Test subscriptions.

To create `GraphQlTester`, you only need a `GraphQlService`, and no transport:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	GraphQlSource graphQlSource = GraphQlSource.builder()
			.schemaResources(...)
			.runtimeWiring(...)
			.build();

	GraphQlService graphQlService = new ExecutionGraphQlService(graphQlSource);

	GraphQlTester graphQlTester = GraphQlTester.builder(graphQlService).build();
----



[[testing-webgraphqltester]]
=== `WebGraphQlTester`

`WebGraphQlTester` extends `GraphQlTester` to add a workflow and configuration specific
to <<web-transports>>. You need one of the following inputs to create it:

- `WebTestClient` -- perform requests as an HTTP client, either against <<web-http>>
handlers without a server, or against a live server.
- `WebGraphQlHandler` -- perform requests through the <<web-interception>> chain used
by both <<web-http>> and <<web-websocket>> handlers, which in effect is testing without
a Web framework. One reason to use this is for <<testing-subscriptions>>.

For Spring WebFlux without a server, you can point to your Spring configuration:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	ApplicationContext context = ... ;

	WebTestClient client =
			WebTestClient.bindToApplicationContext(context)
					.configureClient()
					.baseUrl("/graphql")
					.build();

	WebGraphQlTester tester = WebGraphQlTester.builder(client).build();
----

For Spring MVC without a server, use the `MockMvcWebTestClient` builder:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	WebApplicationContext context = ... ;

	WebTestClient client =
			MockMvcWebTestClient.bindToApplicationContext(context)
					.configureClient()
					.baseUrl("/graphql")
					.build();

	WebGraphQlTester tester = WebGraphQlTester.builder(client).build();
----

For tests against a live, running server:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	WebTestClient client =
			WebTestClient.bindToServer()
					.baseUrl("http://localhost:8080/graphql")
					.build();

	WebGraphQlTester tester = WebGraphQlTester.builder(client).build();
----



[[testing-queries]]
=== Queries

Below is an example query test using
https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath[JsonPath] to extract all release versions in the
GraphQL response.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	String query = "{" +
			"  project(slug:\"spring-framework\") {" +
			"    releases {" +
			"      version" +
			"    }"+
			"  }" +
			"}";

	graphQlTester.query(query)
			.execute()
			.path("project.releases[*].version")
			.entityList(String.class)
			.hasSizeGreaterThan(1);
----

The JsonPath is relative to the "data" section of the response.



[[testing-errors]]
=== Errors

Tests cannot use verify data, if there are errors under the "errors" key in the response
has errors. If necessary to ignore an error, use an error filter `Predicate`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	graphQlTester.query(query)
			.execute()
			.errors()
			.filter(error -> ...)
			.verify()
			.path("project.releases[*].version")
			.entityList(String.class)
			.hasSizeGreaterThan(1);
----

An error filter can be registered globally and apply to all tests:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	WebGraphQlTester graphQlTester = WebGraphQlTester.builder(client)
			.errorFilter(error -> ...)
			.build();
----

Or inspect all errors directly and that also marks them as filtered:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	graphQlTester.query(query)
			.execute()
			.errors()
			.satisfy(errors -> {
				// ...
			});
----

If a request does not have any response data (e.g. mutation), use `executeAndVerify`
instead of `execute` to verify there are no errors in the response:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	graphQlTester.query(query).executeAndVerify();
----



[[testing-subscriptions]]
=== Subscriptions

The `executeSubscription` method defines a workflow specific to subscriptions which return
a stream of responses instead of a single response.

To test subscriptions, you can create `GraphQlTester` with a `GraphQlService`, which
calls `graphql.GraphQL` directly and that returns a stream of responses:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	GraphQlService service = ... ;

	GraphQlTester graphQlTester = GraphQlTester.builder(service).build();

	Flux<String> result = graphQlTester.query("subscription { greetings }")
		.executeSubscription()
		.toFlux("greetings", String.class);  // decode each response
----

The `StepVerifier` from Project Reactor is useful to verify a stream:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Flux<String> result = graphQlTester.query("subscription { greetings }")
		.executeSubscription()
		.toFlux("greetings", String.class);

	StepVerifier.create(result)
			.expectNext("Hi")
			.expectNext("Bonjour")
			.expectNext("Hola")
			.verifyComplete();
----

To test with the <<web-interception>> chain, you can create `WebGraphQlTester` with a
`WebGraphQlHandler`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	GraphQlService service = ... ;

	WebGraphQlHandler handler = WebGraphQlHandler.builder(service)
		.interceptor((input, next) -> next.handle(input))
		.build();

	WebGraphQlTester graphQlTester = WebGraphQlTester.builder(handler).build();
----

Currently, Spring GraphQL does not support testing with a WebSocket client, and it
cannot be used for integration test of GraphQL over WebSocket requests.




[[boot-graphql]]
== Boot Starter

This projects builds on Boot 2.5.x, but it should be compatible with the latest Boot 2.4.x.



[[boot-graphql-project]]
=== Project Setup

To create a project, go to https://start.spring.io and select starter(s) for the
GraphQL transports you want to use:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Starter | Transport | Implementation

| `spring-boot-starter-web`
| HTTP
| Spring MVC

| `spring-boot-starter-websocket`
| WebSocket
| WebSocket for Servlet apps

| `spring-boot-starter-webflux`
| HTTP, WebSocket
| Spring WebFlux

|===

In the generated project, add `graphql-spring-boot-starter` manually:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
.Gradle
----
dependencies {
	// Spring GraphQL Boot starter
	implementation 'org.springframework.experimental:graphql-spring-boot-starter:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'

	// ...
}

repositories {
	mavenCentral()
	maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/milestone' }  // Spring milestones
	maven { url 'https://repo.spring.io/snapshot' }   // Spring snapshots
}
----
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="secondary"]
.Maven
----
<dependencies>

	// Spring GraphQL Boot starter
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.experimental</groupId>
		<artifactId>graphql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>

	<!-- ... -->

</dependencies>

<!-- For Spring project milestones or snapshot releases -->
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestones</id>
		<name>Spring Milestones</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
	</repository>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshots</id>
		<name>Spring Snapshots</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
		<snapshots>
			<enabled>true</enabled>
		</snapshots>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

[NOTE]
.Boot Starter Group Id
====
The Boot starter will move from the Spring GraphQL repository to the Spring Boot
repository, after Spring Boot 2.6 is released. The group id for the starter will then
change from `org.springframework.experimental` to `org.springframework.boot` and will be
released in Spring Boot 2.7.
====



[[boot-graphql-schema]]
=== Schema

By default, GraphQL schema files are expected to be in `src/main/resources/graphql` and have
the extension ".graphqls", ".graphql", ".gql", or ".gqls". You can customize the
schema locations to check as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
spring.graphql.schema.locations=classpath:graphql/
----

The GraphQL schema can be viewed over HTTP at "/graphql/schema". This is not enabled by
default:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
spring.graphql.schema.printer.enabled=false
----


[[boot-graphql-datafetcher]]
=== `DataFetcher` Registration

You can declare `RuntimeWiringCustomizer` beans in your Spring config and use those to
register data fetchers, type resolvers, and more with the GraphQL engine:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Component
public class PersonDataWiring implements RuntimeWiringCustomizer {

	private final PersonService service;

	public PersonDataWiring(PersonService service) {
		this.service = service;
	}

	@Override
	public void customize(RuntimeWiring.Builder builder) {
		builder.type("Query", wiring ->
				wiring.dataFetcher("people", env -> this.service.findAll()));
	}
}
----


[[boot-graphql-web]]
=== Web Endpoints

The GraphQL HTTP endpoint is at HTTP POST "/graphql" by default. The path can be customized:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
spring.graphql.path=/graphql
----

The GraphQL WebSocket endpoint supports WebSocket handshakes at "/graphql" by default.
The below shows the properties that apply for WebSocket handling:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
spring.graphql.websocket.path=/graphql

# Time within which a "CONNECTION_INIT" message must be received from the client
spring.graphql.websocket.connection-init-timeout=60s
----

The GraphQL WebSocket endpoint is off by default. To enable it:

- For a Servlet application, add the WebSocket starter `spring-boot-starter-websocket`.
- For a WebFlux application, set the `spring.graphql.websocket.path` application property.

Declare a `WebInterceptor` bean to have it registered in the<<web-interception>> for
GraphQL over HTTP and WebSocket requests.

Declare a `ThreadLocalAccessor` bean to assist with the propagation of `ThreadLocal`
values of interest in <<execution-context-webmvc>>.



[[boot-graphql-graphiql]]
=== GraphiQL

The Spring Boot starter includes a https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL] page
that is exposed at "/graphiql" by default. You can configure this as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true
spring.graphql.graphiql.path=/graphiql
----




[[boot-graphql-metrics]]
=== Metrics

When the starter `spring-boot-starter-actuator` is present on the classpath, metrics for
GraphQL requests are collected. You can disable metrics collection as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
management.metrics.graphql.autotime.enabled=false
----

Metrics can be exposed with an Actuator web endpoint.
The following sections assume that its exposure is enabled in your application configuration, as follows:

[source,properties,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,metrics,info
----


[[boot-graphql-metrics-request-timer]]
==== Request Timer

A Request metric timer is available at `/actuator/metrics/graphql.request`.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Tag | Description| Sample values

|outcome
|Request outcome
|"SUCCESS", "ERROR"
|===


[[boot-graphql-metrics-datafetcher-timer]]
==== `DataFetcher` Timer

A `DataFetcher` metric timer is available at `/actuator/metrics/graphql.datafetcher`.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Tag | Description| Sample values

|path
|data fetcher path
|"Query.project"

|outcome
|data fetching outcome
|"SUCCESS", "ERROR"
|===


[[boot-graphql-metrics-error-counter]]
==== Error Counter

A GraphQL error metric counter is available at `/actuator/metrics/graphql.error`.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Tag | Description| Sample values

|errorType
|error type
|"DataFetchingException"

|errorPath
|error JSON Path
|"$.project"
|===



[[boot-graphql-testing]]
=== Testing

When the starter `spring-boot-starter-test` is present on the classpath, a `WebGraphQlTester`
is configured and available for injection into tests.

For GraphQL over HTTP with Spring MVC, using `MockMvc` as the server:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
@AutoConfigureGraphQlTester
public class MockMvcGraphQlTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebGraphQlTester graphQlTester;

}
----

For GraphQL over HTTP with Spring WebFlux, using a
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.testing.spring-boot-applications.with-mock-environment[mock server]:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
@AutoConfigureGraphQlTester
public class MockMvcGraphQlTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebGraphQlTester graphQlTester;

}
----

For GraphQL over HTTP with a
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.testing.spring-boot-applications.with-running-server[running server]:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureGraphQlTester
public class MockMvcGraphQlTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebGraphQlTester graphQlTester;

}
----

Subscriptions can be tested without WebSocket as shown below:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureGraphQlTester
public class MockMvcGraphQlTests {

	@Autowired
	private WebGraphQlTester graphQlTester;

	@Test
	void subscription() {
		Flux<String> result = this.graphQlTester.query("subscription { greetings }")
				.executeSubscription()
				.toFlux("greetings", String.class);

		// Use StepVerifier from "reactor-test" to verify the stream...
		StepVerifier.create(result)
				.expectNext("Hi")
				.expectNext("Bonjour")
				.expectNext("Hola")
				.verifyComplete();
	}

}
----

The above subscription test is performed directly against the `WebGraphQlHandler` that
both HTTP and WebSocket transports delegate to. It passes through the `WebInterceptor`
chain and then calls GraphQL Java which returns a Reactive Streams `Publisher`.




[[samples]]
== Samples

This Spring GraphQL repository contains {repository}/samples[sample applications] for
various scenarios.

You can run those by cloning this repository and running main application classes from
your IDE or by typing the following on the command line:

[source,bash,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
$ ./gradlew :samples:{sample-directory-name}:bootRun
----
