[[client]]
= Client

Spring for GraphQL includes client support for executing GraphQL requests over HTTP,
WebSocket, and RSocket.



[[client-graphqlclient]]
== `GraphQlClient`

`GraphQlClient` is a contract that declares a common workflow for GraphQL requests that is
independent of the underlying transport. That means requests are executed with the same API
no matter what the underlying transport, and anything transport specific is configured at
build time.

To create a `GraphQlClient` you need one of the following extensions:

- <<client-httpgraphqlclient, HttpGraphQlClient>>
- <<client-websocketgraphqlclient, WebSocketGraphQlClient>>
- <<client-rsocketgraphqlclient, RSocketGraphQlClient>>

Each defines a `Builder` with options relevant to the transport. All builders extend
from a common, base GraphQlClient <<client-graphqlclient-builder, `Builder`>> with options
relevant to all extensions.

Once you have a `GraphQlClient` you can begin to make <<client-requests, requests>>.


[[client-httpgraphqlclient]]
=== HTTP

`HttpGraphQlClient` uses
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/web-reactive.html#webflux-client[WebClient] to execute
GraphQL requests over HTTP.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
WebClient webClient = ... ;
HttpGraphQlClient graphQlClient = HttpGraphQlClient.create(webClient);
----

Once `HttpGraphQlClient` is created, you can begin to
<<client-requests, execute requests>> using the same API, independent of the underlying
transport. If you need to change any transport specific details, use `mutate()` on an
existing `HttpGraphQlClient` to create a new instance with customized settings:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    WebClient webClient = ... ;

	HttpGraphQlClient graphQlClient = HttpGraphQlClient.builder(webClient)
			.headers(headers -> headers.setBasicAuth("joe", "..."))
			.build();

	// Perform requests with graphQlClient...

	HttpGraphQlClient anotherGraphQlClient = graphQlClient.mutate()
			.headers(headers -> headers.setBasicAuth("peter", "..."))
			.build();

	// Perform requests with anotherGraphQlClient...

----



[[client-websocketgraphqlclient]]
=== WebSocket

`WebSocketGraphQlClient` executes GraphQL requests over a shared WebSocket connection.
It is built using the
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/web-reactive.html#webflux-websocket-client[WebSocketClient]
from Spring WebFlux and you can create it as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	String url = "wss://localhost:8080/graphql";
	WebSocketClient client = new ReactorNettyWebSocketClient();

	WebSocketGraphQlClient graphQlClient = WebSocketGraphQlClient.builder(url, client).build();
----

In contrast to `HttpGraphQlClient`, the `WebSocketGraphQlClient` is connection oriented,
which means it needs to establish a connection before making any requests. As you begin
to make requests, the connection is established transparently. Alternatively, use the
client's `start()` method to establish the connection explicitly before any requests.

In addition to being connection-oriented, `WebSocketGraphQlClient` is also multiplexed.
It maintains a single, shared connection for all requests. If the connection is lost,
it is re-established on the next request or if `start()` is called again. You can also
use the client's `stop()` method which cancels in-progress requests, closes the
connection, and rejects new requests.

TIP: Use a single `WebSocketGraphQlClient` instance for each server in order to have a
single, shared connection for all requests to that server. Each client instance
establishes its own connection and that is typically not the intent for a single server.

Once `WebSocketGraphQlClient` is created, you can begin to
<<client-requests, execute requests>> using the same API, independent of the underlying
transport. If you need to change any transport specific details, use `mutate()` on an
existing `WebSocketGraphQlClient` to create a new instance with customized settings:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	URI url = ... ;
	WebSocketClient client = ... ;

	WebSocketGraphQlClient graphQlClient = WebSocketGraphQlClient.builder(url, client)
			.headers(headers -> headers.setBasicAuth("joe", "..."))
			.build();

	// Use graphQlClient...

	WebSocketGraphQlClient anotherGraphQlClient = graphQlClient.mutate()
			.headers(headers -> headers.setBasicAuth("peter", "..."))
			.build();

	// Use anotherGraphQlClient...

----


[[client-websocketgraphqlclient-interceptor]]
==== Interceptor

The https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md[GraphQL over WebSocket]
protocol defines a number of connection oriented messages in addition to executing
requests. For example, a client sends `"connection_init"` and the server responds with
`"connection_ack"` at the start of a connection.

For WebSocket transport specific interception, you can create a
`WebSocketGraphQlClientInterceptor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	static class MyInterceptor implements WebSocketGraphQlClientInterceptor {

		@Override
		public Mono<Object> connectionInitPayload() {
			// ... the "connection_init" payload to send
		}

		@Override
		public Mono<Void> handleConnectionAck(Map<String, Object> ackPayload) {
			// ... the "connection_ack" payload received
		}

	}
----

<<client-interception,Register>> the above interceptor as any other
`GraphQlClientInterceptor` and use it also to intercept GraphQL requests, but note there
can be at most one interceptor of type `WebSocketGraphQlClientInterceptor`.



[[client-rsocketgraphqlclient]]
=== RSocket

`RSocketGraphQlClient` uses
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/web-reactive.html#rsocket-requester[RSocketRequester]
to execute GraphQL requests over RSocket requests.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	URI uri = URI.create("wss://localhost:8080/rsocket");
	WebsocketClientTransport transport = WebsocketClientTransport.create(url);

	RSocketGraphQlClient client = RSocketGraphQlClient.builder()
			.clientTransport(transport)
			.build();
----

In contrast to `HttpGraphQlClient`, the `RSocketGraphQlClient` is connection oriented,
which means it needs to establish a session before making any requests. As you begin
to make requests, the session is established transparently. Alternatively, use the
client's `start()` method to establish the session explicitly before any requests.

`RSocketGraphQlClient` is also multiplexed. It maintains a single, shared session for
all requests.  If the session is lost, it is re-established on the next request or if
`start()` is called again. You can also use the client's `stop()` method which cancels
in-progress requests, closes the session, and rejects new requests.

TIP: Use a single `RSocketGraphQlClient` instance for each server in order to have a
single, shared session for all requests to that server. Each client instance
establishes its own connection and that is typically not the intent for a single server.

Once `RSocketGraphQlClient` is created, you can begin to
<<client-requests, execute requests>> using the same API, independent of the underlying
transport.



[[client-graphqlclient-builder]]
=== Builder

`GraphQlClient` defines a parent `Builder` with common configuration options for the
builders of all extensions. Currently, it has lets you configure:

- `DocumentSource` strategy to load the document for a request from a file
- <<client-interception>> of executed requests




[[client-requests]]
== Requests

Once you have a <<client-graphqlclient>>, you can begin to perform requests via
<<client-requests-retrieve, retrieve()>> or <<client-requests-execute, execute()>>
where the former is only a shortcut for the latter.



[[client-requests-retrieve]]
=== Retrieve

The below retrieves and decodes the data for a query:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	String document = "{" +
			"  project(slug:\"spring-framework\") {" +
			"	name" +
			"	releases {" +
			"	  version" +
			"	}"+
			"  }" +
			"}";

	Mono<Project> projectMono = graphQlClient.document(document) <1>
			.retrieve("project") <2>
			.toEntity(Project.class); <3>
----
<1> The operation to perform.
<2> The path under the "data" key in the response map to decode from.
<3> Decode the data at the path to the target type.

The input document is a `String` that could be a literal or produced through a code
generated request object. You can also define documents in files and use a
<<client-requests-document-source>> to resole them by file name.

The path is relative to the "data" key and uses a simple dot (".") separated notation
for nested fields with optional array indices for list elements, e.g. `"project.name"`
or `"project.releases[0].version"`.

Decoding can result in `FieldAccessException` if the given path is not present, or the
field value is `null` and has an error. `FieldAccessException` provides access to the
response and the field:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Mono<Project> projectMono = graphQlClient.document(document)
			.retrieve("project")
			.toEntity(Project.class)
			.onErrorResume(FieldAccessException.class, ex -> {
				ClientGraphQlResponse response = ex.getResponse();
				// ...
				ResponseField field = ex.getField();
				// ...
			});
----



[[client-requests-execute]]
=== Execute

<<client-requests-retrieve>> is only a shortcut to decode from a single path in the
response map. For more control, use the `execute` method and handle the response:

For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----

	Mono<Project> projectMono = graphQlClient.document(document)
			.execute()
			.map(response -> {
				if (!response.isValid()) {
					// Request failure... <1>
				}

				ResponseField field = response.field("project");
				if (!field.hasValue()) {
					if (field.getError() != null) {
						// Field failure... <2>
					}
					else {
						// Optional field set to null... <3>
					}
				}

				return field.toEntity(Project.class); <4>
			});
----
<1> The response does not have data, only errors
<2> Field that is `null` and has an associated error
<3> Field that was set to `null` by its `DataFetcher`
<4> Decode the data at the given path



[[client-requests-document-source]]
=== Document Source

The document for a request is a `String` that may be defined in a local variable or
constant, or it may be produced through a code generated request object.

You can also create document files with extensions `.graphql` or `.gql` under
`"graphql-documents/"` on the classpath and refer to them by file name.

For example, given a file called `projectReleases.graphql` in
`src/main/resources/graphql-documents`, with content:

[source,graphql,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
.src/main/resources/graphql-documents/projectReleases.graphql
----
	query projectReleases($slug: ID!) {
		project(slug: $slug) {
			name
			releases {
				version
			}
		}
	}
----

You can then:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Mono<Project> projectMono = graphQlClient.documentName("projectReleases") <1>
			.variable("slug", "spring-framework") <2>
			.retrieve()
			.toEntity(Project.class);
----
<1> Load the document from "projectReleases.graphql"
<2> Provide variable values.

The "JS GraphQL" plugin for IntelliJ supports GraphQL query files with code completion.

You can use the `GraphQlClient` <<client-graphqlclient-builder>> to customize the
`DocumentSource` for loading documents by names.




[[client-subscriptions]]
== Subscription Requests

`GraphQlClient` can execute subscriptions over transports that support it. Currently, only
the WebSocket transport supports GraphQL streams, so you'll need to create a
<<client-websocketgraphqlclient,WebSocketGraphQlClient>>.



[[client-subscriptions-retrieve]]
=== Retrieve

To start a subscription stream, use `retrieveSubscription` which is similar to
<<client-requests-retrieve,retrieve>> for a single response but returning a stream of
responses, each decoded to some data:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Flux<String> greetingFlux = client.document("subscription { greetings }")
			.retrieveSubscription("greeting")
			.toEntity(String.class);
----

A subscription stream may end with:

- `SubscriptionErrorException` if the server ends the
subscription with an explicit "error" message that contains one or more GraphQL errors.
The exception provides access to the GraphQL errors decoded from that message.
- `GraphQlTransportException` such as `WebSocketDisconnectedException` if the underlying
connection is closed or lost in which case you can use the `retry` operator to reestablish
the connection and start the subscription again.






[[client-subscriptions-execute]]
=== Execute

<<client-subscriptions-retrieve>> is only a shortcut to decode from a single path in each
response map. For more control, use the `executeSubscription` method and handle each
response directly:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	Flux<String> greetingFlux = client.document("subscription { greetings }")
			.executeSubscription()
			.map(response -> {
				if (!response.isValid()) {
					// Request failure...
				}

				ResponseField field = response.field("project");
				if (!field.hasValue()) {
					if (field.getError() != null) {
						// Field failure...
					}
					else {
						// Optional field set to null... <3>
					}
				}

				return field.toEntity(String.class)
			});
----




[[client-interception]]
== Interception

You create a `GraphQlClientInterceptor` to intercept all requests through a client:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
static class MyInterceptor implements GraphQlClientInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<ClientGraphQlResponse> intercept(ClientGraphQlRequest request, Chain chain) {
		// ...
		return chain.next(request);
	}

	@Override
	public Flux<ClientGraphQlResponse> interceptSubscription(ClientGraphQlRequest request, SubscriptionChain chain) {
		// ...
		return chain.next(request);
	}

}
----

Once the interceptor is created, register it through the client builder:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	URI url = ... ;
	WebSocketClient client = ... ;

	WebSocketGraphQlClient graphQlClient = WebSocketGraphQlClient.builder(url, client)
			.interceptor(new MyInterceptor())
			.build();
----
