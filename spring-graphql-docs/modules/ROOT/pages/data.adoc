[[data]]
= Data Integration

Spring for GraphQL lets you leverage existing Spring technology, following common
programming models to expose underlying data sources through GraphQL.

This section discusses an integration layer for Spring Data that provides an easy way to
adapt a Querydsl or a Query by Example repository to a `DataFetcher`, including the
option for automated detection and GraphQL Query registration for repositories marked
with `@GraphQlRepository`.



[[data.querydsl]]
== Querydsl

Spring for GraphQL supports use of http://www.querydsl.com/[Querydsl] to fetch data through
the Spring Data
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#core.extensions[Querydsl extension].
Querydsl provides a flexible yet typesafe approach to express query predicates by
generating a meta-model using annotation processors.

For example, declare a repository as `QuerydslPredicateExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QuerydslPredicateExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Then use it to create a `DataFetcher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();

	// For paginated queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).scrollable();
----

You can now register the above `DataFetcher` through a
xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.graphqlsource.runtimewiring-configurer[`RuntimeWiringConfigurer`].

The `DataFetcher` builds a Querydsl `Predicate` from GraphQL arguments, and uses it to
fetch data. Spring Data supports `QuerydslPredicateExecutor` for JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, and LDAP.

NOTE: For a single argument that is a GraphQL input type, `QuerydslDataFetcher` nests one
level down, and uses the values from the argument sub-map.

If the repository is `ReactiveQuerydslPredicateExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB and Neo4j.


[[data.querydsl.build]]
=== Build Setup

To configure Querydsl in your build, follow the
https://querydsl.com/static/querydsl/latest/reference/html/ch02.html[official reference documentation]:

For example:

[tabs]
======
Gradle::
+
[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="primary"]
----
dependencies {
	//...

	annotationProcessor "com.querydsl:querydsl-apt:$querydslVersion:jakarta",
			'jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api'
}

compileJava {
	options.annotationProcessorPath = configurations.annotationProcessor
}
----

Maven::
+
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="secondary"]
----
<build>
	<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>

				</configuration>
			</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
----
======


[[data.querydsl.customizations]]
=== Customizations

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports customizing how GraphQL arguments are bound onto properties
to create a Querydsl `Predicate`. By default, arguments are bound as "is equal to" for
each available property. To customize that, you can use `QuerydslDataFetcher` builder
methods to provide a `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`.

A repository may itself be an instance of `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`. This is auto-detected
and transparently applied during xref:data.adoc#data.querydsl.registration[Auto-Registration]. However, when manually
building a `QuerydslDataFetcher` you will need to use builder methods to apply it.

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports interface and DTO projections to transform query results
before returning these for further GraphQL processing.

TIP: To learn what projections are, please refer to the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[Spring Data docs].
To understand how to use projections in GraphQL, please see xref:data.adoc#data.projections[Selection Set vs Projections].

To use Spring Data projections with Querydsl repositories, create either a projection interface
or a target DTO class and configure it through the `projectAs` method to obtain a
`DataFetcher` producing the target type:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class Account {

		String name, identifier, description;

		Person owner;
	}

	interface AccountProjection {

		String getName();

		String getIdentifier();
	}

	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<AccountProjection> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<AccountProjection>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).many();
----



[[data.querydsl.registration]]
=== Auto-Registration

If a repository is annotated with `@GraphQlRepository`, it is automatically registered
for queries that do not already have a registered `DataFetcher` and whose return type
matches that of the repository domain type. This includes single value queries, multi-value
queries, and xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination[paginated] queries.

By default, the name of the GraphQL type returned by the query must match the simple name
of the repository domain type. If needed, you can use the `typeName` attribute of
`@GraphQlRepository` to specify the target GraphQL type name.

For paginated queries, the simple name of the repository domain type must match the
`Connection` type name without the `Connection` ending (e.g. `**Book**` matches
`**Books**Connection`). For auto-registration, pagination is offset-based with 20 items
per page.

Auto-registration detects if a given repository implements `QuerydslBinderCustomizer` and
transparently applies that through `QuerydslDataFetcher` builder methods.

Auto-registration is performed through a built-in `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` that can be
obtained from `QuerydslDataFetcher`. The xref:boot-starter.adoc[Boot Starter] automatically
detects `@GraphQlRepository` beans and uses them to initialize the
`RuntimeWiringConfigurer` with.

Auto-registration applies xref:data.adoc#data.querybyexample.customizations[customizations]
by calling `customize(Builder)` on the repository instance if your repository
implements `QuerydslBuilderCustomizer` or `ReactiveQuerydslBuilderCustomizer`
respectively.


[[data.querybyexample]]
== Query by Example

Spring Data supports the use of
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#query-by-example[Query by Example]
to fetch data. Query by Example (QBE) is a simple querying technique that does not require
you to write queries through store-specific query languages.

Start by declaring a repository that is `QueryByExampleExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QueryByExampleExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Use `QueryByExampleDataFetcher` to turn the repository into a `DataFetcher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();

	// For paginated queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).scrollable();
----

You can now register the above `DataFetcher` through a
xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.graphqlsource.runtimewiring-configurer[`RuntimeWiringConfigurer`].

The `DataFetcher` uses the GraphQL arguments map to create the domain type of the
repository and use that as the example object to fetch data with. Spring Data supports
`QueryByExampleDataFetcher` for JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis.

NOTE: For a single argument that is a GraphQL input type, `QueryByExampleDataFetcher`
nests one level down, and binds with the values from the argument sub-map.

If the repository is `ReactiveQueryByExampleExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis, and R2dbc.


[[data.querybyexample.build]]
=== Build Setup

Query by Example is already included in the Spring Data modules for the data stores where
it is supported, so no extra setup is required to enable it.


[[data.querybyexample.customizations]]
=== Customizations

`QueryByExampleDataFetcher` supports interface and DTO projections to transform query
results before returning these for further GraphQL processing.

TIP: To learn what projections are, please refer to the

or a target DTO class and configure it through the `projectAs` method to obtain a
`DataFetcher` producing the target type:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	class Account {

		String name, identifier, description;

		Person owner;
	}

	interface AccountProjection {

		String getName();

		String getIdentifier();
	}

	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<AccountProjection> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<AccountProjection>> dataFetcher =
			QueryByExampleDataFetcher.builder(repository).projectAs(AccountProjection.class).many();
----


[[data.querybyexample.registration]]
=== Auto-Registration

If a repository is annotated with `@GraphQlRepository`, it is automatically registered
for queries that do not already have a registered `DataFetcher` and whose return type
matches that of the repository domain type. This includes single value queries, multi-value
queries, and xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination[paginated] queries.

By default, the name of the GraphQL type returned by the query must match the simple name
of the repository domain type. If needed, you can use the `typeName` attribute of
`@GraphQlRepository` to specify the target GraphQL type name.

Auto-registration applies xref:data.adoc#data.querybyexample.customizations[customizations]
by calling `customize(Builder)` on the repository instance if your repository
implements `QueryByExampleBuilderCustomizer` or
`ReactiveQueryByExampleBuilderCustomizer` respectively.



[[data.projections]]
== Selection Set vs Projections

A common question that arises is, how GraphQL selection sets compare to
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[Spring Data projections]
and what role does each play?

The short answer is that Spring for GraphQL is not a data gateway that translates GraphQL
queries directly into SQL or JSON queries. Instead, it lets you leverage existing Spring
technology and does not assume a one for one mapping between the GraphQL schema and the
underlying data model. That is why client-driven selection and server-side transformation
of the data model can play complementary roles.

To better understand, consider that Spring Data promotes domain-driven (DDD) design as
the recommended approach to manage complexity in the data layer. In DDD, it is important
to adhere to the constraints of an aggregate. By definition an aggregate is valid only if
loaded in its entirety, since a partially loaded aggregate may impose limitations on
aggregate functionality.

In Spring Data you can choose whether you want your aggregate be exposed as is, or
whether to apply transformations to the data model before returning it as a GraphQL
result. Sometimes it's enough to do the former, and by default the
xref:data.adoc#data.querydsl[Querydsl] and the xref:data.adoc#data.querybyexample[Query by Example] integrations turn the GraphQL
selection set into property path hints that the underlying Spring Data module uses to
limit the selection.

In other cases, it's useful to reduce or even transform the underlying data model in
order to adapt to the GraphQL schema. Spring Data supports this through Interface
and DTO Projections.

Interface projections define a fixed set of properties to expose where properties may or
may not be `null`, depending on the data store query result. There are two kinds of
interface projections both of which determine what properties to load from the underlying
data source:

- https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.interfaces.closed[Closed interface projections]
are helpful if you cannot partially materialize the aggregate object, but you still
want to expose a subset of properties.
- https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.interfaces.open[Open interface projections]
leverage Spring's `@Value` annotation and
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/core/expressions.html[SpEL]  expressions to apply lightweight
data transformations, such as concatenations, computations, or applying static functions
to a property.

DTO projections offer a higher level of customization as you can place transformation
code either in the constructor or in getter methods.

DTO projections materialize from a query where the individual properties are
determined by the projection itself. DTO projections are commonly used with full-args
constructors (e.g. Java records), and therefore they can only be constructed if all
required fields (or columns) are part of the database query result.



[[data.pagination.scroll]]
== Scroll

As explained in xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination[Pagination], the GraphQL Cursor Connection spec defines a
mechanism for pagination with `Connection`, `Edge`, and `PageInfo` schema types, while
GraphQL Java provides the equivalent Java type representations.

Spring for GraphQL provides built-in ``ConnectionAdapter`` implementations to adapt the
Spring Data pagination types `Window` and `Slice` transparently. You can configure that
as follows:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
CursorStrategy<ScrollPosition> strategy = CursorStrategy.withEncoder(
		new ScrollPositionCursorStrategy(),
		CursorEncoder.base64()); // <1>

GraphQLTypeVisitor visitor = ConnectionFieldTypeVisitor.create(List.of(
		new WindowConnectionAdapter(strategy),
		new SliceConnectionAdapter(strategy))); // <2>

GraphQlSource.schemaResourceBuilder()
		.schemaResources(..)
		.typeDefinitionConfigurer(..)
		.typeVisitors(List.of(visitor)); // <3>
----

<1> Create strategy to convert `ScrollPosition` to a Base64 encoded cursor.
<2> Create type visitor to adapt `Window` and `Slice` returned from ``DataFetcher``s.
<3> Register the type visitor.

On the request side, a controller method can declare a
xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.subrange[ScrollSubrange] method argument to paginate forward
or backward. For this to work, you must declare a xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination.cursor.strategy[`CursorStrategy`]
supports `ScrollPosition` as a bean.

The xref:boot-starter.adoc[Boot Starter] declares a `CursorStrategy<ScrollPosition>` bean, and registers the
`ConnectionFieldTypeVisitor` as shown above if Spring Data is on the classpath.


[[data.pagination.scroll.keyset]]
== Keyset Position

For `KeysetScrollPosition`, the cursor needs to be created from a keyset, which is
essentially a `Map` of key-value pairs. To decide how to create a cursor from a keyset,
you can configure `ScrollPositionCursorStrategy` with `CursorStrategy<Map<String, Object>>`.
By default, `JsonKeysetCursorStrategy` writes the keyset `Map` to JSON. That works for
simple like String, Boolean, Integer, and Double, but others cannot be restored back to the
same type without target type information. The Jackson library has a default typing feature
that can include type information in the JSON. To use it safely you must specify a list of
allowed types. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	PolymorphicTypeValidator validator = BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
			.allowIfBaseType(Map.class)
			.allowIfSubType(ZonedDateTime.class)
			.build();

	ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
	mapper.activateDefaultTyping(validator, ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL);
----

You can then create `JsonKeysetCursorStrategy`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	ObjectMapper mapper = ... ;

	CodecConfigurer configurer = ServerCodecConfigurer.create();
	configurer.defaultCodecs().jacksonJsonDecoder(new JacksonJsonDecoder(mapper));
	configurer.defaultCodecs().jacksonJsonEncoder(new JacksonJsonEncoder(mapper));

	JsonKeysetCursorStrategy strategy = new JsonKeysetCursorStrategy(configurer);
----

By default, if `JsonKeysetCursorStrategy` is created without a `CodecConfigurer` and the
Jackson library is on the classpath, customizations like the above are applied for
`Date`, `Calendar`, and any type from `java.time`.



[[data.pagination.sort]]
== Sort

Spring for GraphQL defines a `SortStrategy` to create `Sort` from GraphQL arguments.
`AbstractSortStrategy` implements the contract with abstract methods to extract the sort
direction and properties. To enable support for `Sort` as a controller method argument,
you need to declare a `SortStrategy` bean.



[[data.transaction-management]]
== Transaction Management

At some point when working with data atomicity and isolation of operations start to
matter. These are both properties of transactions. GraphQL itself does not define any
transaction semantics, so it is up to the server and your application to decide how to
handle transactions.

GraphQL and specifically GraphQL Java are designed to be non-opinionated about how data
is fetched. A core property of GraphQL is that clients drive the request; Fields
can be resolved independently of their original source to allow for composition.
A reduced fieldset can require less data to be fetched resulting in better performance.

Applying the concept of distributed field resolution within transactions is not a good fit:

* Transactions keep a unit of work together resulting typically in fetching the entire
object graph (like a typical object-relational mapper would behave) within a single
transaction. This is at odds with GraphQL's core design to let the client drive queries.

* Keeping a transaction open across multiple data fetchers of which each one would
fetch only its flat object mitigates the performance aspect and aligns with decoupled
field resolution, but it can lead to long-running transactions that hold on to resources
for longer than necessary.

Generally speaking, transactions are best applied to mutations that change state and not
necessarily to queries that just read data. However, there are use cases where
transactional reads are required.

GraphQL is designed to support multiple mutations within a single request. Depending on
the use case, you might want to:

* Run each mutation within its own transaction.
* Keep some mutations within a single transaction to ensure a consistent state.
* Span a single transaction over all involved mutations.

Each approach requires a slightly different transaction management strategy.

When using Spring Framework (e.g. JDBC) or Spring Data, the Template API and repositories
default (without any further instrumentation) to use implicit transactions for individual
operations resulting in starting and commiting a transaction for each repository method
call. This is the normal mode of operation for most databases.

The following sections are outlining two different strategies to manage transactions in a
GraphQL server:

1. <<data.transaction-management.transactional-service-methods,Transaction per Controller Method>>
2. <<data.transaction-management.transactional-instrumentation,Spanning a Transaction programmatically over the entire request>>


[[data.transaction-management.transactional-service-methods]]
=== Transactional Controller Methods

The simplest approach to manage transactions is to use Spring's Transaction Management
together with `@MutationMapping` controller methods (or any other `@SchemaMapping` method)
for example:

[tabs]
======
Declarative::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="primary"]
----
@Controller
public class AccountController {

	@MutationMapping
	@Transactional
	public Account addAccount(@Argument AccountInput input) {
		// ...
	}
}
----

Programmatic::
+
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",role="secondary"]
----
@Controller
public class AccountController {

	private final TransactionOperations transactionOperations;

	@MutationMapping
	public Account addAccount(@Argument AccountInput input) {
		return transactionOperations.execute(status -> {
			// ...
		});
	}
}
----
======

A transaction spans from entering the `addAccount` method until its return.
All invocations to transactional resources are part of the same transaction resulting in
atomicity and isolation of the mutation.

This is the recommended approach. It gives you full control over transaction boundaries
with a clearly defined entrypoint without the need to instrument GraphQL server
infrastructure.

Cleaning up a transaction after the method call results that subsequent data fetching
(e.g. for nested fields) is not part of the transactional method `addAccount` as
outlined below:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class AccountController {

	@MutationMapping
	@Transactional
	public Account addAccount(@Argument AccountInput input) {    <1>
		// ...
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	@Transactional
	public Person person(Account account) {                      <2>
		... // fetching the person within a separate transaction
	}
}
----
<1> The `addAccount` method invocation runs within its own transaction.
<2> The `person` method invocation creates its own, separate transaction that is not
tied to the `addAccount` method in case both methods were invoked as part of the same
GraphQL request. A separate transaction comes with all possible drawbacks of not
being part of the same transaction, such as non-repeatable reads or inconsistencies
in case the data has been modified between the `addAcount` and `person` method invocations.

To run multiple mutations in a single transaction maintaining a simple setup we recommend
designing a mutation method that accepts all required inputs. This method can then call
multiple service methods, ensuring they all participate in the same transaction.


[[data.transaction-management.transactional-instrumentation]]
=== Transactional Instrumentation

Applying a Transactional Instrumentation is a more advanced approach to span a
transaction over the entire execution of a GraphQL request. By stating a transaction
before the first data fetcher is invoked your application can ensure that all data
fetchers can participate in the same transaction.

When instrumenting the server, you need to ensure an `ExecutionStrategy` runs
`DataFetcher` invocations serially so that all invocations are executed on the same
`Thread`. This is mandatory: Synchronous transaction management uses `ThreadLocal` state
to allow participation in transactions. Considering `AsyncSerialExecutionStrategy` as
starting point is a good choice as it executes data fetchers serially.

You have two general options to implement transactional instrumentation:

1. GraphQL Java's `Instrumentation` contract allows to hook into the execution lifecycle
at various stages. The Instrumentation SPI was designed with observability in mind, yet it
serves as execution-agnostic extension points regardless of whether you're using
synchronous reactive, or any other asynchronous form to invoke data fetchers and is less
opinionated in that regard.

2. An `ExecutionStrategy` provides full control over the execution and opens a variety
of possibilities how to communicate failed transactions or errors during transaction
cleanup back to the client. It can also serve as good entry point to implement custom
directives that allow clients specifying transactional attributes through directives or
using directives in your schema to demarcate transactional boundaries for certain queries
or mutations.

When manually managing transactions, ensure to clean up the transaction, that is either
commiting or rolling back, after completing the unit of work.
`ExceptionWhileDataFetching` can be a useful `GraphQLError` to obtain an underlying
`Exception`. This error is constructed when using `SimpleDataFetcherExceptionHandler`.
By default, Spring GraphQL falls back to an internal `GraphQLError` that doesn't expose
the original exception.

Applying transactional instrumentation creates opportunities to rethink transaction
participation: All `@SchemaMapping` controller methods participate in the transaction
regardless whether they are invoked for the root, nested fields, or as part of a mutation.
Transactional controller methods (or service methods within the invocation chain) can
declare transactional attributes such as propagation behavior `REQUIRES_NEW` to start
a new transaction if required.
