[[controllers]]
= Annotated Controllers

Spring for GraphQL provides an annotation-based programming model where `@Controller`
components use annotations to declare handler methods with flexible method signatures to
fetch the data for specific GraphQL fields. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class GreetingController {

			@QueryMapping // <1>
			public String hello() { // <2>
				return "Hello, world!";
			}

	}
----
<1> Bind this method to a query, i.e. a field under the Query type.
<2> Determine the query from the method name if not declared on the annotation.

Spring for GraphQL uses `RuntimeWiring.Builder` to register the above handler method as a
`graphql.schema.DataFetcher` for the query named "hello".


[[controllers-declaration]]
== Declaration

You can define `@Controller` beans as standard Spring bean definitions. The
`@Controller` stereotype allows for auto-detection, aligned with Spring general
support for detecting `@Controller` and `@Component` classes on the classpath and
auto-registering bean definitions for them. It also acts as a stereotype for the annotated
class, indicating its role as a data fetching component in a GraphQL application.

`AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` detects `@Controller` beans and registers their
annotated handler methods as ``DataFetcher``s via `RuntimeWiring.Builder`. It is an
implementation of `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` which can be added to `GraphQlSource.Builder`.
The xref:boot-starter.adoc[Boot Starter] automatically declares `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` as a bean
and adds all `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` beans to `GraphQlSource.Builder` and that enables
support for annotated ``DataFetcher``s, see the
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/reference/web/spring-graphql.html#web.graphql.runtimewiring[GraphQL RuntimeWiring] section
in the Boot starter documentation.


[[controllers.schema-mapping]]
== `@SchemaMapping`

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation maps a handler method to a field in the GraphQL schema
and declares it to be the `DataFetcher` for that field. The annotation can specify the
parent type name, and the field name:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book", field="author")
		public Author getAuthor(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can also leave out those attributes, in which case the
field name defaults to the method name, while the type name defaults to the simple class
name of the source/parent object injected into the method. For example, the below
defaults to type "Book" and field "author":

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can be declared at the class level to specify a default
type name for all handler methods in the class.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book")
	public class BookController {

		// @SchemaMapping methods for fields of the "Book" type

	}
----

`@QueryMapping`, `@MutationMapping`, and `@SubscriptionMapping` are meta annotations that
are themselves annotated with `@SchemaMapping` and have the typeName preset to `Query`,
`Mutation`, or `Subscription` respectively. Effectively, these are shortcut annotations
for fields under the Query, Mutation, and Subscription types respectively. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}

		@SubscriptionMapping
		public Flux<Book> newPublications() {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

`@SchemaMapping` handler methods have flexible signatures and can choose from a range of
method arguments and return values..


[[controllers.schema-mapping.signature]]
=== Method Arguments

Schema mapping handler methods can have any of the following method arguments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Method Argument | Description

| `@Argument`
| For access to a named field argument bound to a higher-level, typed Object.

See xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.argument[`@Argument`].

| `@Argument Map<String, Object>`
| For access to the raw argument value.

See xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.argument[`@Argument`].

| `ArgumentValue`
| For access to a named field argument bound to a higher-level, typed Object along
with a flag to indicate if the input argument was omitted vs set to `null`.

See xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.argument-value[`ArgumentValue`].

| `@Arguments`
| For access to all field arguments bound to a higher-level, typed Object.

See xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.arguments[`@Arguments`].

| `@Arguments Map<String, Object>`
| For access to the raw map of arguments.

| `@ProjectedPayload` Interface
| For access to field arguments through a project interface.

See xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.projectedpayload.argument[`@ProjectedPayload` Interface].

| "Source"
| For access to the source (i.e. parent/container) instance of the field.

See xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.source[Source].

| `Subrange` and `ScrollSubrange`
| For access to pagination arguments.

See xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination[Pagination], xref:data.adoc#data.pagination.scroll[Scroll], xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.subrange[`Subrange`].

| `Sort`
| For access to sort details.

See xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination[Pagination], xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.sort[`Sort`].

| `DataLoader`
| For access to a `DataLoader` in the `DataLoaderRegistry`.

See xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.data-loader[`DataLoader`].

| `@ContextValue`
| For access to an attribute from the main `GraphQLContext` in `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `@LocalContextValue`
| For access to an attribute from the local `GraphQLContext` in `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `GraphQLContext`
| For access to the context from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Obtained from the Spring Security context, if available.

| `@AuthenticationPrincipal`
| For access to `Authentication#getPrincipal()` from the Spring Security context.

| `DataFetchingFieldSelectionSet`
| For access to the selection set for the query through the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `Locale`, `Optional<Locale>`
| For access to the `Locale` from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `DataFetchingEnvironment`
| For direct access to the underlying `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

|===


[[controllers.schema-mapping.return.values]]
=== Return Values

Schema mapping handler methods can return:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Return Value | Description

| A resolved value `T`
| Any application type directly resolved.

| `Mono<T>` and `Flux<T>`
| For asynchronous value(s).

Supported for controller methods and for any `DataFetcher` as described in xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.reactive-datafetcher[Reactive `DataFetcher`].

| Kotlin `suspend fun` and `Flow`
| They are automatically adapted to `Mono` and `Flux`.

| `java.util.concurrent.Callable<T>`
| For producing value(s) asynchronously.
For this to work, `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` must be configured with an `Executor`.
On Java 21+, returning `T` directly is enough. Read the paragraph after this table for more details.

| `graphql.execution.DataFetcherResult<P>`
| With `P` being any of the types listed above (`T`, `Mono<T>`, etc.).

This is the "full" GraphQL Java return value, containing not only the "data".
Useful for completing the result with "extensions" or a xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.localcontext["Local Context"].

|===

On Java 21+, when `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` is configured with an `Executor`, controller
methods with a blocking method signature are invoked asynchronously. By default, a controller
method is considered blocking if it does not return an async type such as `Flux`, `Mono`,
`CompletableFuture`, and is also not a Kotlin suspending function. You can configure a
blocking controller method `Predicate` on `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` to help
determine which methods are considered blocking.

TIP: The Spring Boot starter for Spring for GraphQL automatically configures
`AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` with an `Executor` for virtual threads when the property
`spring.threads.virtual.enabled` is set.


[[controllers.schema-mapping.interfaces]]
=== Interface Schema Mappings

When a controller method is mapped to a schema interface field, by default the mapping is
replaced with multiple mappings, one for each schema object type that implements the interface.
This allows use of one controller method for all subtypes.

For example, given:

[source,graphql,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	type Query {
		activities: [Activity!]!
	}

	interface Activity {
		id: ID!
		coordinator: User!
	}

	type FooActivity implements Activity {
		id: ID!
		coordinator: User!
	}

	type BarActivity implements Activity {
		id: ID!
		coordinator: User!
	}

	type User {
		name: String!
	}
----

You can write a controller like this:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class ActivityController {

		@QueryMapping
		public List<Activity> activities() {
			// ...
		}

		@SchemaMapping
		public User coordinator(Activity activity) {
			// Called for any Activity subtype
		}

	}
----

If necessary, you can take over the mapping for individual subtypes:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class ActivityController {

		@QueryMapping
		public List<Activity> activities() {
			// ...
		}

		@SchemaMapping
		public User coordinator(Activity activity) {
			// Called for any Activity subtype except FooActivity
		}

		@SchemaMapping
		public User coordinator(FooActivity activity) {
			// ...
		}

	}
----


[[controllers.schema-mapping.argument]]
=== `@Argument`

In GraphQL Java, `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to a map of field-specific
argument values. The values can be simple scalar values (e.g. String, Long), a `Map` of
values for more complex input, or a `List` of values.

Use the `@Argument` annotation to have an argument bound to a target object and
injected into the handler method. Binding is performed by mapping argument values to a
primary data constructor of the expected method parameter type, or by using a default
constructor to create the object and then map argument values to its properties. This is
repeated recursively, using all nested argument values and creating nested target objects
accordingly. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

TIP: If the target object doesn't have setters, and you can't change that, you can use a
property on `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` to allow falling back on binding via direct
field access.

By default, if the method parameter name is available (requires the `-parameters` compiler
flag with Java 8+ or debugging info from the compiler), it is used to look up the argument.
If needed, you can customize the name through the annotation, e.g. `@Argument("bookInput")`.

TIP: The `@Argument` annotation does not have a "required" flag, nor the option to
specify a default value. Both of these can be specified at the GraphQL schema level and
are enforced by GraphQL Java.

If binding fails, a `BindException` is raised with binding issues accumulated as field
errors where the `field` of each error is the argument path where the issue occurred.

You can use `@Argument` with a `Map<String, Object>` argument, to obtain the raw value of
the argument. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument Map<String, Object> bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

NOTE: Prior to 1.2, `@Argument Map<String, Object>` returned the full arguments map if
the annotation did not specify a name. After 1.2, `@Argument` with
`Map<String, Object>` always returns the raw argument value, matching either to the name
specified in the annotation, or to the parameter name. For access to the full arguments
map, please use xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.arguments[`@Arguments`] instead.


[[controllers.schema-mapping.argument-value]]
=== `ArgumentValue`

By default, input arguments in GraphQL are nullable and optional, which means an argument
can be set to the `null` literal, or not provided at all. This distinction is useful for
partial updates with a mutation where the underlying data may also be, either set to
`null` or not changed at all accordingly. When using xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.argument[`@Argument`]
there is no way to make such a distinction, because you would get `null` or an empty
`Optional` in both cases.

If you want to know not whether a value was not provided at all, you can declare an
`ArgumentValue` method parameter, which is a simple container for the resulting value,
along with a flag to indicate whether the input argument was omitted altogether. You
can use this instead of `@Argument`, in which case the argument name is determined from
the method parameter name, or together with `@Argument` to specify the argument name.

For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@MutationMapping
		public void addBook(ArgumentValue<BookInput> bookInput) {
			if (!bookInput.isOmitted()) {
				BookInput value = bookInput.value();
				// ...
			}
		}
	}
----

`ArgumentValue` is also supported as a field within the object structure of an `@Argument`
method parameter, either initialized via a constructor argument or via a setter, including
as a field of an object nested at any level below the top level object.


[[controllers.schema-mapping.arguments]]
=== `@Arguments`

Use the `@Arguments` annotation, if you want to bind the full arguments map onto a single
target Object, in contrast to `@Argument`, which binds a specific, named argument.

For example, `@Argument BookInput bookInput` uses the value of the argument "bookInput"
to initialize `BookInput`, while `@Arguments` uses the full arguments map and in that
case, top-level arguments are bound to `BookInput` properties.

You can use `@Arguments` with a `Map<String, Object>` argument, to obtain the raw map of
all argument values.


[[controllers.schema-mapping.projectedpayload.argument]]
=== `@ProjectedPayload` Interface

As an alternative to using complete Objects with xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.argument[`@Argument`],
you can also use a projection interface to access GraphQL request arguments through a
well-defined, minimal interface. Argument projections are provided by
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections.interfaces[Spring Data's Interface projections]
when Spring Data is on the class path.

To make use of this, create an interface annotated with `@ProjectedPayload` and declare
it as a controller method parameter. If the parameter is annotated with `@Argument`,
it applies to an individual argument within the `DataFetchingEnvironment.getArguments()`
map. When declared without `@Argument`, the projection works on top-level arguments in
the complete arguments map.

For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(BookIdProjection bookId) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInputProjection bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}

	@ProjectedPayload
	interface BookIdProjection {

		Long getId();
	}

	@ProjectedPayload
	interface BookInputProjection {

		String getName();

		@Value("#{target.author + ' ' + target.name}")
		String getAuthorAndName();
	}
----



[[controllers.schema-mapping.source]]
=== Source

In GraphQL Java, the `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to the source (i.e.
parent/container) instance of the field. To access this, simply declare a method parameter
of the expected target type.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The source method argument also helps to determine the type name for the mapping.
If the simple name of the Java class matches the GraphQL type, then there is no need to
explicitly specify the type name in the `@SchemaMapping` annotation.

[TIP]
====
A xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.batch-mapping[`@BatchMapping`] handler method can batch load all authors for a query,
given a list of source/parent books objects.
====


[[controllers.schema-mapping.subrange]]
=== `Subrange`

When there is a xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination.cursor.strategy[`CursorStrategy`] bean in Spring configuration,
controller methods support a `Subrange<P>` argument where `<P>` is a relative position
converted from a cursor. For Spring Data, `ScrollSubrange` exposes `ScrollPosition`.
For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	@QueryMapping
	public Window<Book> books(ScrollSubrange subrange) {
		ScrollPosition position = subrange.position().orElse(ScrollPosition.offset());
		int count = subrange.count().orElse(20);
		// ...
	}

}
----

See xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.pagination[Pagination] for an overview of pagination and of built-in mechanisms.


[[controllers.schema-mapping.sort]]
=== `Sort`

When there is a xref:data.adoc#data.pagination.scroll[SortStrategy] bean in Spring configuration, controller
methods support `Sort` as a method argument. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	@QueryMapping
	public Window<Book> books(Optional<Sort> optionalSort) {
		Sort sort = optionalSort.orElse(Sort.by(..));
	}

}
----



[[controllers.schema-mapping.data-loader]]
=== `DataLoader`

When you register a batch loading function for an entity, as explained in
xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.batching[Batch Loading], you can access the `DataLoader` for the entity by declaring a
method argument of type `DataLoader` and use it to load the entity:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	public BookController(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {
		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerMappedBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
			// return Map<Long, Author>
		});
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	public CompletableFuture<Author> author(Book book, DataLoader<Long, Author> loader) {
		return loader.load(book.getAuthorId());
	}

}
----

By default, `BatchLoaderRegistry` uses the full class name of the value type (e.g. the
class name for `Author`) for the key of the registration, and therefore simply declaring
the `DataLoader` method argument with generic types provides enough information
to locate it in the `DataLoaderRegistry`. As a fallback, the `DataLoader` method argument
resolver will also try the method argument name as the key but typically that should not
be necessary.

Note that for many cases with loading related entities, where the `@SchemaMapping` simply
delegates to a `DataLoader`, you can reduce boilerplate by using a
xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.batch-mapping[@BatchMapping] method as described in the next section.


[[controllers.schema-mapping.validation]]
=== Validation

When a `javax.validation.Validator` bean is found, `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` enables support for
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/core/validation/beanvalidation.html#validation-beanvalidation-overview[Bean Validation]
on annotated controller methods. Typically, the bean is of type `LocalValidatorFactoryBean`.

Bean validation lets you declare constraints on types:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class BookInput {

	@NotNull
	private String title;

	@NotNull
	@Size(max=13)
	private String isbn;
}
----

You can then annotate a controller method parameter with `@Valid` to validate it before
method invocation:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument @Valid BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

If an error occurs during validation, a `ConstraintViolationException` is raised.
You can use the xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.exceptions[Exceptions] chain to decide how to present that to clients
by turning it into an error to include in the GraphQL response.

TIP: In addition to `@Valid`, you can also use Spring's `@Validated` that allows
specifying validation groups.

Bean validation is useful for xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.argument[`@Argument`],
xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.arguments[`@Arguments`], and
xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.projectedpayload.argument[@ProjectedPayload]
method parameters, but applies more generally to any method parameter.

[WARNING]
.Validation and Kotlin Coroutines
====
Hibernate Validator is not compatible with Kotlin Coroutine methods and fails when
introspecting their method parameters. Please see
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql/issues/344#issuecomment-1082814093[spring-projects/spring-graphql#344 (comment)]
for links to relevant issues and a suggested workaround.
====

[[controllers.schema-mapping.localcontext]]
=== Local Context

The main `GraphQlContext` is global for the entire query and can be used to store and retrieve cross-cutting context data for observability, security and more.
There are times when you would like to pass additional information to child fields data fetchers and avoid polluting the main context.
For such use cases, you should consider a local `GraphQLContext` as it is contained to a subset of the data fetching operations.

Controller methods can contribute a local context by returning a `DataFetcherResult<T>` that holds the resolved data and the new context:

include-code::LocalContextBookController[tag=localcontext,indent=0]

If you want to see a more detailed example and discussion of using this, have a look at
https://www.graphql-java.com/blog/deep-dive-data-fetcher-results[the "Building efficient data fetchers by looking ahead" section on the graphql-java documentation].


[[controllers.batch-mapping]]
== `@BatchMapping`

xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.batching[Batch Loading] addresses the N+1 select problem through the use of an
`org.dataloader.DataLoader` to defer the loading of individual entity instances, so they
can be loaded together. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	public BookController(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {
		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerMappedBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
			// return Map<Long, Author>
		});
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	public CompletableFuture<Author> author(Book book, DataLoader<Long, Author> loader) {
		return loader.load(book.getAuthorId());
	}

}
----

For the straight-forward case of loading an associated entity, shown above, the
`@SchemaMapping` method does nothing more than delegate to the `DataLoader`. This is
boilerplate that can be avoided with a `@BatchMapping` method. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@BatchMapping
		public Mono<Map<Book, Author>> author(List<Book> books) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The above becomes a batch loading function in the `BatchLoaderRegistry`
where keys are `Book` instances and the loaded values their authors. In addition, a
`DataFetcher` is also transparently bound to the `author` field of the type `Book`, which
simply delegates to the `DataLoader` for authors, given its source/parent `Book` instance.

[TIP]
====
To be used as a unique key, `Book` must implement `hashcode` and `equals`.
====

By default, the field name defaults to the method name, while the type name defaults to
the simple class name of the input `List` element type. Both can be customized through
annotation attributes. The type name can also be inherited from a class level
`@SchemaMapping`.


[[controllers.batch-mapping.signature]]
=== Method Arguments

Batch mapping methods support the following arguments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Method Argument | Description

| `List<K>`
| The source/parent objects.

| `java.security.Principal`
| Obtained from Spring Security context, if available.

| `@ContextValue`
| For access to a value from the `GraphQLContext` of `BatchLoaderEnvironment`,
  which is the same context as the one from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `GraphQLContext`
| For access to the context from the `BatchLoaderEnvironment`,
  which is the same context as the one from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

| `BatchLoaderEnvironment`
| The environment that is available in GraphQL Java to a
  `org.dataloader.BatchLoaderWithContext`.

  The `context` property of `BatchLoaderEnvironment` returns the same
  `GraphQLContext` instance that is also available to `@SchemaMapping`
  methods through the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

  The `keyContexts` property of `BatchLoaderEnvironment` returns the
  localContext obtained from the `DataFetchingEnvironment` when the
  `DataLoader` was called for each key.

|===


[[controllers.batch-mapping.return.values]]
=== Return Values

Batch mapping methods can return:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Return Type | Description

| `Mono<Map<K,V>>`
| A map with parent objects as keys, and batch loaded objects as values.

| `Flux<V>`
| A sequence of batch loaded objects that must be in the same order as the source/parent
  objects passed into the method.

| `Map<K,V>`, `Collection<V>`
| Imperative variants, e.g. without remote calls to make.

| `Callable<Map<K,V>>`, `Callable<Collection<V>>`
| Imperative variants to be invoked asynchronously. For this to work,
  `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` must be configured with an `Executor`.

| Kotlin Coroutine with `Map<K,V>`, Kotlin `Flow<K,V>`
| Adapted to `Mono<Map<K,V>` and `Flux<V>`.

|===

On Java 21+, when `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` is configured with an `Executor`, controller
methods with a blocking method signature are invoked asynchronously. By default, a controller
method is considered blocking if it does not return an async type such as `Flux`, `Mono`,
`CompletableFuture`, and is also not a Kotlin suspending function. You can configure a
blocking controller method `Predicate` on `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` to help
determine which methods are considered blocking.

TIP: The Spring Boot starter for Spring for GraphQL automatically configures
`AnnotatedControllerConfigurer` with an `Executor` for virtual threads when the property
`spring.threads.virtual.enabled` is set.



[[controllers.batch-mapping.interfaces]]
=== Interface Batch Mappings

As is the case with xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.interfaces[Interface Schema Mappings],
when a batch mapping method is mapped to a schema interface field, the mapping is replaced with
multiple mappings, one for each schema object type that implements the interface.

That means, given the following:

[source,graphql,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	type Query {
		activities: [Activity!]!
	}

	interface Activity {
		id: ID!
		coordinator: User!
	}

	type FooActivity implements Activity {
		id: ID!
		coordinator: User!
	}

	type BarActivity implements Activity {
		id: ID!
		coordinator: User!
	}

	type User {
		name: String!
	}
----

You can write a controller like this:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public List<Activity> activities() {
			// ...
		}

		@BatchMapping
		Map<Activity, User> coordinator(List<Activity> activities) {
			// Called for all Activity subtypes
		}
	}
----

If necessary, you can take over the mapping for individual subtypes:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public List<Activity> activities() {
			// ...
		}

		@BatchMapping
		Map<Activity, User> coordinator(List<Activity> activities) {
			// Called for all Activity subtypes
		}

		@BatchMapping(field = "coordinator")
		Map<Activity, User> fooCoordinator(List<FooActivity> activities) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----





[[controllers.exception-handler]]
== `@GraphQlExceptionHandler`

Use `@GraphQlExceptionHandler` methods to handle exceptions from data fetching with a
flexible xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.exception-handler.signature[method signature]. When declared in a
controller, exception handler methods apply to exceptions from the same controller:

include-code::BookController[]

When declared in an `@ControllerAdvice`, exception handler methods apply across controllers:

include-code::GlobalExceptionHandler[]

As shown in the examples above, you should build errors by injecting `GraphQlErrorBuilder` in the method signature
because it's been prepared with the current `DataFetchingEnvironment`.

Exception handling via `@GraphQlExceptionHandler` methods is applied automatically to
controller invocations. To handle exceptions from other `graphql.schema.DataFetcher`
implementations, not based on controller methods, obtain a
`DataFetcherExceptionResolver` from `AnnotatedControllerConfigurer`, and register it in
`GraphQlSource.Builder` as a xref:request-execution.adoc#execution.exceptions[DataFetcherExceptionResolver].




[[controllers.exception-handler.signature]]
=== Method Signature

Exception handler methods support a flexible method signature with method arguments
resolved from a `DataFetchingEnvironment,` and matching to those of
xref:controllers.adoc#controllers.schema-mapping.arguments[@SchemaMapping methods].

Supported return types are listed below:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Return Type | Description

| `graphql.GraphQLError`
| Resolve the exception to a single field error.

| `Collection<GraphQLError>`
| Resolve the exception to multiple field errors.

| `void`
| Resolve the exception without response errors.

| `Object`
| Resolve the exception to a single error, to multiple errors, or none.
  The return value must be `GraphQLError`, `Collection<GraphQLError>`, or `null`.

| `Mono<T>`
| For asynchronous resolution where `<T>` is one of the supported, synchronous, return types.

[[controllers.namespacing]]
== Namespacing

At the schema level, query and mutation operations are defined directly under the `Query` and `Mutation` types.
Rich GraphQL APIs can define dozens of operations under those types, making it harder to explore the API and separate concerns.
You can choose to https://www.apollographql.com/docs/technotes/TN0012-namespacing-by-separation-of-concern/[define Namespaces in your GraphQL schema].
While there are some caveats with this approach, you can implement this pattern with Spring for GraphQL annotated controllers.

With namespacing, your GraphQL schema can, for example, nest query operations under top-level types, instead of listing them directly under `Query`.
Here, we will define `MusicQueries` and `UserQueries` types and make them available under `Query`:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
include::ROOT:{include-resources}/controllers/namespaces.graphqls[]
----

A GraphQL client would use the `album` query like this:

[source,graphql,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
{
  music {
    album(id: 42) {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
----

And get the following response:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
{
  "data": {
    "music": {
      "album": {
        "id": "42",
        "title": "Spring for GraphQL"
      }
    }
  }
}
----


This can be implemented in a `@Controller` with the following pattern:

include-code::MusicController[]
<1> Annotate the controller with `@SchemaMapping` and a `typeName` attribute, to avoid repeating it on methods
<2> Define a `@QueryMapping` for the "music" namespace
<3> The "music" query returns an "empty" record, but could also return an empty map
<4> Queries are now declared as fields under the "MusicQueries" type

Instead of declaring wrapping types ("MusicQueries", "UserQueries") explicitly in controllers,
you can choose to configure them with the runtime wiring using a `GraphQlSourceBuilderCustomizer` with Spring Boot:

include-code::NamespaceConfiguration[]
<1> List all the wrapper types for the "Query" type
<2> Manually declare data fetchers for each of them, returning an empty Map
