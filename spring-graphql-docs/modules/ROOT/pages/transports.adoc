[[server.transports]]
= Server Transports

Spring for GraphQL supports server handling of GraphQL requests over HTTP, WebSocket, and
RSocket.


[[server.transports.http]]
== HTTP

`GraphQlHttpHandler` handles GraphQL over HTTP requests and delegates to the
xref:transports.adoc#server.interception[Interception] chain for request execution. There are two variants, one for
Spring MVC and one for Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have
equivalent functionality, but rely on blocking vs non-blocking I/O respectively for
writing the HTTP response.

Requests must use HTTP POST with `"application/json"` as content type and GraphQL request details
included as JSON in the request body. Clients can request the `"application/graphql-response+json"` media type
to get the behavior defined in the official
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md[GraphQL over HTTP] specification.
If the client doesn't express any preference, this will be the content type of choice.
Clients can also request the legacy `"application/json"` media type to get the traditional HTTP behavior.

In practice, GraphQL HTTP clients should expect 4xx/5xx HTTP responses if the server is unavailable, security credentials
are missing or if the request body is not valid JSON. `"application/graphql-response+json"` responses will also use
4xx statuses if the GraphQL document sent by the client cannot be parsed or is considered invalid by the GraphQL engine.
In this case, `"application/json"` responses will still use 200 (OK).
Once the GraphQL request has been successfully validated, the HTTP response status is always 200 (OK),
and any errors from GraphQL request execution appear in the "errors" section of the GraphQL response.

`GraphQlHttpHandler` can be exposed as an HTTP endpoint by declaring a `RouterFunction`
bean and using the `RouterFunctions` from Spring MVC or WebFlux to create the route. The
xref:boot-starter.adoc[Boot Starter] does this, see the
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/reference/web/spring-graphql.html#web.graphql.transports.http-websocket[Web Endpoints] section for
details, or check `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration`
it contains, for the actual config.

By default, the `GraphQlHttpHandler` will serialize and deserialize JSON payloads using the `HttpMessageConverter` (Spring MVC)
and the `DecoderHttpMessageReader/EncoderHttpMessageWriter` (WebFlux) configured in the web framework.
In some cases, the application will configure the JSON codec for the HTTP endpoint in a way that is not compatible with the GraphQL payloads.
Applications can instantiate `GraphQlHttpHandler` with a custom JSON codec that will be used for GraphQL payloads.

The 1.0.x branch of this repository contains a Spring MVC
{github-10x-branch}/samples/webmvc-http[HTTP sample] application.


[[server.transports.sse]]
== Server-Sent Events

`GraphQlSseHandler` is very similar to the HTTP handler listed above, but this time handling GraphQL requests over HTTP
using the Server-Sent Events protocol. With this transport, clients must send HTTP POST requests to the endpoint with
`"application/json"` as content type and GraphQL request details included as JSON in the request body; the only
difference with the vanilla HTTP variant is that the client must send `"text/event-stream"` as the `"Accept"` request
header. The response will be sent as one or more Server-Sent Event(s).

This is also defined in the proposed
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/GraphQLOverSSE.md[GraphQL over HTTP] specification.
Spring for GraphQL only implements the "Distinct connections mode", so applications must consider scalability concerns
and whether adopting HTTP/2 as the underlying transport would help.

The main use case for `GraphQlSseHandler` is an alternative to the
xref:transports.adoc#server.transports.websocket[WebSocket transport], receiving a stream of items as a response to a
subscription operation. Other types of operations, like queries and mutations, are not supported here and should be
using the plain JSON over HTTP transport variant.


[[server.transports.http.fileupload]]
=== File Upload

As a protocol GraphQL focuses on the exchange of textual data. This doesn't include binary
data such as images, but there is a separate, informal
https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec[graphql-multipart-request-spec]
that allows file uploads with GraphQL over HTTP.

Spring for GraphQL does not support the `graphql-multipart-request-spec` directly.
While the spec does provide the benefit of a unified GraphQL API, the actual experience has
led to a number of issues, and best practice recommendations have evolved, see
https://www.apollographql.com/blog/backend/file-uploads/file-upload-best-practices/[Apollo Server File Upload Best Practices]
for a more detailed discussion.

If you would like to use `graphql-multipart-request-spec` in your application, you can
do so through the library
https://github.com/nkonev/multipart-spring-graphql[multipart-spring-graphql].


[[server.transports.websocket]]
== WebSocket

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` handles GraphQL over WebSocket requests based on the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md[protocol] defined in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The main reason to use
GraphQL over WebSocket is subscriptions which allow sending a stream of GraphQL
responses, but it can also be used for regular queries with a single response.
The handler delegates every request to the xref:transports.adoc#server.interception[Interception] chain for further
request execution.

[TIP]
.GraphQL Over WebSocket Protocols
====
There are two such protocols, one in the
https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws[subscriptions-transport-ws]
library and another in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The former is not active and
succeeded by the latter. Read this
https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-over-websockets[blog post] for the history.
====

There are two variants of `GraphQlWebSocketHandler`, one for Spring MVC and one for
Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have equivalent functionality.
The WebFlux handler also uses non-blocking I/O and back pressure to stream messages,
which works well since in GraphQL Java a subscription response is a Reactive Streams
`Publisher`.

The `graphql-ws` project lists a number of
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws#recipes[recipes] for client use.

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` can be exposed as a WebSocket endpoint by declaring a
`SimpleUrlHandlerMapping` bean and using it to map the handler to a URL path. By default,
the xref:boot-starter.adoc[Boot Starter] does not expose a GraphQL over WebSocket endpoint,
but you can add a property for the endpoint path to enable it. Please, review
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/reference/web/spring-graphql.html#web.graphql.transports.http-websocket[Web Endpoints]
in the Boot reference documentation, and the list of supported `spring.graphql.websocket`
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/appendix/application-properties/index.html#appendix.application-properties.web[properties].
You can also look at `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration`
for the actual Boot autoconfig details.

The 1.0.x branch of this repository contains a WebFlux
{github-10x-branch}/samples/webflux-websocket[WebSocket sample] application.



[[server.transports.rsocket]]
== RSocket

`GraphQlRSocketHandler` handles GraphQL over RSocket requests. Queries and mutations are
expected and handled as an RSocket `request-response` interaction while subscriptions are
handled as `request-stream`.

`GraphQlRSocketHandler` can be used a delegate from an `@Controller` that is mapped to
the route for GraphQL requests. For example:

include-code::GraphQlRSocketController[]




[[server.interception]]
== Interception

Server transports allow intercepting requests before and after the GraphQL Java engine is
called to process a request.


[[server.interception.web]]
=== `WebGraphQlInterceptor`

xref:transports.adoc#server.transports.http[HTTP] and xref:transports.adoc#server.transports.websocket[WebSocket]
transports invoke a chain of 0 or more `WebGraphQlInterceptor`, followed by an
`ExecutionGraphQlService` that calls the GraphQL Java engine.
Interceptors allow applications to intercept incoming requests in order to:

- Check HTTP request details
- Customize the `graphql.ExecutionInput`
- Add HTTP response headers
- Customize the `graphql.ExecutionResult`
- and more

For example, an interceptor can pass an HTTP request header to a `DataFetcher`:

include-code::RequestHeaderInterceptor[]
<1> Interceptor adds HTTP request header value into GraphQLContext
<2> Data controller method accesses the value

Reversely, an interceptor can access values added to the `GraphQLContext` by a controller:

include-code::ResponseHeaderInterceptor[]
<1> Controller adds value to the `GraphQLContext`
<2> Interceptor uses the value to add an HTTP response header

`WebGraphQlHandler` can modify the `ExecutionResult`, for example, to inspect and modify
request validation errors that are raised before execution begins and which cannot be
handled with a `DataFetcherExceptionResolver`:

include-code::RequestErrorInterceptor[]
<1> Return the same if `ExecutionResult` has a "data" key with non-null value
<2> Check and transform the GraphQL errors
<3> Update the `ExecutionResult` with the modified errors

Use `WebGraphQlHandler` to configure the `WebGraphQlInterceptor` chain. This is supported
by the xref:boot-starter.adoc[Boot Starter], see
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/reference/web/spring-graphql.html#web.graphql.transports.http-websocket[Web Endpoints].


[[server.interception.websocket]]
=== `WebSocketGraphQlInterceptor`

`WebSocketGraphQlInterceptor` extends `WebGraphQlInterceptor` with additional callbacks
to handle the start and end of a WebSocket connection, in addition to client-side
cancellation of subscriptions. The same also intercepts every GraphQL request on the
WebSocket connection.

Use `WebGraphQlHandler` to configure the `WebGraphQlInterceptor` chain. This is supported
by the xref:boot-starter.adoc[Boot Starter], see
{spring-boot-ref-docs}/reference/web/spring-graphql.html#web.graphql.transports.http-websocket[Web Endpoints].
There can be at most one `WebSocketGraphQlInterceptor` in a chain of interceptors.

There are two built-in WebSocket interceptors called `AuthenticationWebSocketInterceptor`,
one for the WebMVC and one for the WebFlux transports. These help to extract authentication
details from the payload of a `"connection_init"` GraphQL over WebSocket message, authenticate,
and then propagate the `SecurityContext` to subsequent requests on the WebSocket connection.

TIP: There is a websocket-authentication sample in {examples-repo}[spring-graphql-examples].



[[server.interception.rsocket]]
=== `RSocketQlInterceptor`

Similar to xref:transports.adoc#server.interception.web[`WebGraphQlInterceptor`], an `RSocketQlInterceptor` allows intercepting
GraphQL over RSocket requests before and after GraphQL Java engine execution. You can use
this to customize the `graphql.ExecutionInput` and the `graphql.ExecutionResult`.
