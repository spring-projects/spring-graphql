= Testing

Spring for GraphQL provides dedicated support for testing GraphQL requests over HTTP,
WebSocket, and RSocket, as well as for testing directly against a server.

To make use of this, add `spring-graphql-test` to your build:

[[testing.graphqltester]]
== `GraphQlTester`

`GraphQlTester` is a contract that declares a common workflow for testing GraphQL
requests that is independent of the underlying transport. That means requests are tested
with the same API no matter what the underlying transport, and anything transport
specific is configured at build time.

To create a `GraphQlTester` that performs requests through a client, you need one of the
following extensions:

- xref:testing.adoc#testing.httpgraphqltester[HttpGraphQlTester]
- xref:testing.adoc#testing.websocketgraphqltester[WebSocketGraphQlTester]
- xref:testing.adoc#testing.rsocketgraphqltester[RSocketGraphQlTester]

To create a `GraphQlTester` that performs tests on the server side, without a client:

- xref:testing.adoc#testing.graphqlservicetester[ExecutionGraphQlServiceTester]
- xref:testing.adoc#testing.webgraphqltester[WebGraphQlTester]

Each defines a `Builder` with options relevant to the transport. All builders extend
from a common, base GraphQlTester xref:testing.adoc#testing.graphqltester.builder[`Builder`] with
options relevant to all extensions.



[[testing.httpgraphqltester]]
=== HTTP

`HttpGraphQlTester` uses
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/testing/webtestclient.html[WebTestClient] to execute
GraphQL requests over HTTP, with or without a live server, depending on how
`WebTestClient` is configured.

To test in Spring WebFlux, without a live server, point to your Spring configuration
that declares the GraphQL HTTP endpoint:

include-code::HttpSetup[tag=webTestClient,indent=0]

To test in Spring MVC, without a live server, do the same using `MockMvcWebTestClient`:

include-code::HttpSetup[tag=mockMvc,indent=0]

Or to test against a live server running on a port:

include-code::HttpSetup[tag=liveServer,indent=0]

Once `HttpGraphQlTester` is created, you can begin to
xref:testing.adoc#testing.requests[execute requests] using the same API, independent of the underlying
transport. If you need to change any transport specific details, use `mutate()` on an
existing `HttpSocketGraphQlTester` to create a new instance with customized settings:

include-code::HttpSetup[tag=executeRequests,indent=0]

If you need to test with OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication, you can use Spring Security's `mockOidcLogin()` to create a mock OIDC user:

include-code::HttpSetup[tag=oidcAuthentication,indent=0]



[[testing.websocketgraphqltester]]
=== WebSocket

`WebSocketGraphQlTester` executes GraphQL requests over a shared WebSocket connection.
It is built using the
{spring-framework-ref-docs}/web/webflux-websocket.html#webflux-websocket-client[WebSocketClient]
from Spring WebFlux and you can create it as follows:

include-code::WsSetup[tag=setup,indent=0]

`WebSocketGraphQlTester` is connection oriented and multiplexed. Each instance establishes
its own single, shared connection for all requests. Typically, you'll want to use a single
instance only per server.

Once `WebSocketGraphQlTester` is created, you can begin to
xref:testing.adoc#testing.requests[execute requests] using the same API, independent of the underlying
transport. If you need to change any transport specific details, use `mutate()` on an
existing `WebSocketGraphQlTester` to create a new instance with customized settings:

include-code::WsSetup[tag=customSetup,indent=0]

`WebSocketGraphQlTester` provides a `stop()` method that you can use to have the WebSocket
connection closed, e.g. after a test runs.



[[testing.rsocketgraphqltester]]
=== RSocket

`RSocketGraphQlTester` uses `RSocketRequester` from spring-messaging to execute GraphQL
requests over RSocket:

include-code::RSocketSetup[tag=rsocketSetup,indent=0]

`RSocketGraphQlTester` is connection oriented and multiplexed. Each instance establishes
its own single, shared session for all requests. Typically, you'll want to use a single
instance only per server. You can use the `stop()` method on the tester to close the
session explicitly.

Once `RSocketGraphQlTester` is created, you can begin to
xref:testing.adoc#testing.requests[execute requests] using the same API, independent of the underlying
transport.


[[testing.graphqlservicetester]]
=== `ExecutionGraphQlService`

Many times it's enough to test GraphQL requests on the server side, without the use of a
client to send requests over a transport protocol. To test directly against a
`ExecutionGraphQlService`, use the `ExecutionGraphQlServiceTester` extension:

include-code::ServiceSetup[tag=serviceSetup,indent=0]

Once `ExecutionGraphQlServiceTester` is created, you can begin to
xref:testing.adoc#testing.requests[execute requests] using the same API, independent of the underlying
transport.

`ExecutionGraphQlServiceTester.Builder` provides an option to customize `ExecutionInput` details:

include-code::ServiceSetup[tag=customServiceSetup,indent=0]



[[testing.webgraphqltester]]
=== `WebGraphQlHandler`

The xref:testing.adoc#testing.graphqlservicetester[`ExecutionGraphQlService`] extension lets you test on the server side, without
a client. However, in some cases it's useful to involve server side transport
handling with given mock transport input.

The `WebGraphQlTester` extension lets you processes request through the
`WebGraphQlInterceptor` chain before handing off to `ExecutionGraphQlService` for
request execution:

include-code::WebSetup[tag=webSetup,indent=0]

The builder for this extension allows you to define HTTP request details:

include-code::WebSetup[tag=customWebSetup,indent=0]

Once `WebGraphQlTester` is created, you can begin to
xref:testing.adoc#testing.requests[execute requests] using the same API, independent of the underlying transport.



[[testing.graphqltester.builder]]
=== Builder

`GraphQlTester` defines a parent `Builder` with common configuration options for the builders of all supported transports.
It lets you configure the following:

- `errorFilter` - a predicate to suppress expected errors, so you can inspect the data
of the response.
- `documentSource` - a strategy for loading the document for a request from a file on
the classpath or from anywhere else.
- `responseTimeout` - how long to wait for request execution to complete before timing
out.

include-code::GraphQlTesterBuilder[tag=inlineDocument,indent=0]

[[testing.requests]]
== Requests

Once you have a `GraphQlTester`, you can begin to test requests. The below executes a
query for a project and uses https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath[JsonPath] to extract
project release versions from the response:

include-code::TesterRequests[tag=inlineDocument,indent=0]

The JsonPath is relative to the "data" section of the response.

You can also create document files with extensions `.graphql` or `.gql` under
`"graphql-test/"` on the classpath and refer to them by file name.

For example, given a file called `projectReleases.graphql` in
`src/main/resources/graphql-test`, with content:

[source,graphql,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	query projectReleases($slug: ID!) {
		project(slug: $slug) {
			releases {
				version
			}
		}
	}
----

You can then use:

include-code::TesterRequests[tag=documentName,indent=0]
<1> Refer to the document in the file named "project".
<2> Set the `slug` variable.


This approach also works for loading fragments for your queries.
Fragments are reusable field selection sets that avoid repetition in a request document.
For example, we can use a `...releases` fragment in multiple queries:

[source,graphql,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
.src/main/resources/graphql-documents/projectReleases.graphql
----
	query frameworkReleases {
		project(slug: "spring-framework") {
			name
			...releases
		}
	}
	query graphqlReleases {
        project(slug: "spring-graphql") {
            name
            ...releases
        }
    }
----

This fragment can be defined in a separate file for reuse:

[source,graphql,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
.src/main/resources/graphql-documents/releases.graphql
----
	fragment releases on Project {
    	releases {
            version
        }
    }
----


You can then send this fragment along the query document:

include-code::TesterRequests[tag=fragment,indent=0]
<1> Load the document from "projectReleases.graphql"
<2> Load the fragment from "releases.graphql" and append it to the document


[TIP]
====
The "JS GraphQL" plugin for IntelliJ supports GraphQL query files with code completion.
====

If a request does not have any response data, e.g. mutation, use `executeAndVerify`
instead of `execute` to verify there are no errors in the response:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	graphQlTester.query(query).executeAndVerify();
----

See xref:testing.adoc#testing.errors[Errors] for more details on error handling.



[[testing.requests.nestedpaths]]
=== Nested Paths

By default, paths are relative to the "data" section of the GraphQL response. You can also
nest down to a path, and inspect multiple paths relative to it as follows:

include-code::NestedPaths[tag=nestedPaths,indent=0]
<1> Use a callback to inspect paths relative to "project".



[[testing.subscriptions]]
== Subscriptions

To test subscriptions, call `executeSubscription` instead of `execute` to obtain a stream
of responses and then use `StepVerifier` from Project Reactor to inspect the stream:

include-code::TestSubscriptions[tag=testSubscriptions,indent=0]

Subscriptions are supported only with xref:testing.adoc#testing.websocketgraphqltester[WebSocketGraphQlTester]
, or with the server side
xref:testing.adoc#testing.graphqlservicetester[`ExecutionGraphQlService`] and xref:testing.adoc#testing.webgraphqltester[`WebGraphQlHandler`] extensions.



[[testing.errors]]
== Errors

When you use `verify()`, any errors under the "errors" key in the response will cause
an assertion failure. To suppress a specific error, use the error filter before
`verify()`:


include-code::TestErrors[tag=verifyErrors,indent=0]

You can register an error filter at the builder level, to apply to all tests:

include-code::TestErrors[tag=setupErrorFilter,indent=0]

If you want to verify that an error does exist, and in contrast to `filter`, throw an
assertion error if it doesn't, then use `expect` instead:

include-code::TestErrors[tag=expectedErrors,indent=0]

You can also inspect all errors through a `Consumer`, and doing so also marks them as
filtered, so you can then also inspect the data in the response:

include-code::TestErrors[tag=satisfyErrors,indent=0]
